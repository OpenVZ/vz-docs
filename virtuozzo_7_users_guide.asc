Learning Virtuozzo Basics
-------------------------

This chapter provides a brief description of Virtuozzo, virtual machines and containers, their specifications and underlying technologies.

Virtuozzo Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo is a bare-metal virtualization solution that includes container virtualization, KVM-based virtual machines, software-defined storage along with enterprise features and production support. It runs on top of Virtuozzo Linux, a RHEL-based Linux distribution.

Virtuozzo provides the best value for cost-conscious organizations enabling them to:

[options="compact"]
* standardize server hardware platforms,
* effectively consolidate server resources,
* consolidate and support legacy OSs and applications,
* streamline server and application deployment, maintenance, and management,
* simplify software testing and development,
* optimize server and application availability.

OS Virtualization Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides detailed information on the OS virtualization layer responsible for providing support for Virtuozzo containers.

Basics of OS Virtualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OS virtualization allows you to virtualize physical servers on the operating system (kernel) layer. The diagram below shows the basic architecture of OS virtualization.

image::images/osvirtualization.png[align="center"]

The OS virtualization layer ensures isolation and security of resources between different containers. The virtualization layer makes each container appear as a standalone server. Finally, the container itself houses its own applications and workload. OS virtualization is streamlined for the best performance, management, and efficiency. Its main advantages are the following:

[options="compact"]
* Containers perform at levels consistent with native servers. Containers have no virtualized hardware and use native hardware and software drivers making its performance unbeatable.
* Each container can seamlessly scale up to the resources of an entire physical server.
* OS virtualization technology provides the highest density available from a virtualization solution. You can create and run hundreds of containers on a standard production physical server.
* Containers use a single OS, making it extremely simple to maintain and update across containers. Applications may also be deployed as a single instance.

Virtuozzo Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the point of view of applications and container users, each container is an independent system. This independence is provided by the Virtuozzo OS virtualization layer. Note that only a negligible part of the CPU resources is spent on virtualization (around 1-2%). The main features of the virtualization layer implemented in Virtuozzo are the following:

[options="compact"]
* A container looks like a normal Linux system. It has standard startup scripts; software from vendors can run inside containers without any modifications or adjustment.
* A user can change any configuration file and install additional software inside containers.
* Containers are fully isolated from each other (file system, processes, sysctl variables).
* Containers share dynamic libraries, which greatly saves memory.
* Processes belonging to a container are scheduled for execution on all available CPUs. Consequently, containers are not bound to only one CPU and can use all available CPU power.

The two key parts of any container are the contents and configuration. By default, all container files are stored in the +/vz/private/_&lt;UUID&gt;_+ directory on the hardware node, also called _private area_.

.Key Container directories and files
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|File Name|Description

|+/vz/private/_&lt;UUID&gt;_+|Container private area.
|+/vz/private/_&lt;UUID&gt;_/root.hdd/root.hdd+|Virtual hard disk with container contents. The maximum size of the virtual hard disk is 16 TB.
|+/vz/root/_&lt;UUID&gt;_+|Container mount point.
|`ve.conf`|Container configuration file:

[options="compact"]
* Is symlinked to +/etc/vz/conf/_&lt;UUID&gt;_.conf+
* Defines container parameters, such as allocated resource limits, IP address and hostname, and so on.
* Overrides matching parameters in the global configuration file.
|====

All container files are stored in a single image (+/vz/private/_&lt;UUID&gt;_/root.hdd/root.hdd+), similar to a virtual machine's hard disk. Such standalone nature:

[options="compact"]
* Enables easier migrations and backups due to a faster sequential I/O access to container images than to separate container files.
* Removes the need for OS and application templates once a container is created.
* Allows the use of native Linux disk quotas that are journaled and does not require quota recalculation after disasters like server crashes.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Using containers that store all files in an image file (also known as containers with the _container-in-an-image-file_ layout) is supported only for `/vz` partitions formatted as ext4.
====

Templates
^^^^^^^^^

A template (or a package set) in Virtuozzo is a set of original application files repackaged for use by Virtuozzo. Usually, it is just a set of RPM packages for Red Hat like systems. Virtuozzo provides tools for creating templates, installing, upgrading, adding them to and removing them from a container.

Using templates lets you:

[options="compact"]
* Share RAM among similar applications running in different containers to save hundreds of megabytes of memory.
* Deploy applications simultaneously in many containers.
* Use different versions of an application in different containers (for example, perform upgrades only in certain containers).

There are two types of templates: OS and application.

[options="compact"]
* An OS template is an operating system and the standard set of applications to be found right after the installation. Virtuozzo uses OS templates to create new containers with a preinstalled operating system.
* An application template is a set of repackaged software packages optionally accompanied with configuration scripts. Application templates are used to add extra software to existing containers.

For example, you can create a container on the basis of the `redhat` OS template and add the MySQL application to it with the help of the `mysql` template.

Hardware Virtualization Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section familiarizes you with the second component of Virtuozzo--the hardware virtualization layer. This layer provides the necessary environment for creating and managing virtual machines.

Hardware Virtualization Basics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtuozzo is based on the concept of hardware virtualization. Hardware virtualization has a base layer--a hypervisor. This layer is loaded directly on the bare server and acts as an intermediary between the server hardware and virtual machines. To allocate hardware and resources to virtual machines, Virtuozzo virtualizes all hardware on the server. Once virtualized, hardware and resources can be easily assigned to virtual machines. With its virtual hardware, a virtual machine runs its own complete copies of an operating system and applications.

The following diagram shows the basic architecture of hardware virtualization.

image::images/hardwarevirtualization.png[align="center"]

Specifically, Virtuozzo uses the KVM/QEMU hypervisor and manages virtual machines via the libvirt API.

Hardware virtualization enables you to:

[options="compact"]
* Create multiple virtual machines with different operating systems on a single physical host.
* Run multiple guest operating systems and their applications simultaneously on a single physical host without rebooting.
* Consolidate and virtualize the computing environment, reduce hardware costs, lower operating expenses, and increase productivity.
* Use open APIs and SDK for integration with in-house and third-party applications.

Virtuozzo Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the standpoint of applications and virtual machine users, each virtual machine (VM) is an independent system with an independent set of virtual hardware. This independence is provided by the Virtuozzo hardware virtualization layer. The main features of the virtualization layer are the following:

[options="compact"]
* A virtual machine resembles and works like a regular computer. It has its own virtual hardware. Software applications can run in virtual machines without any modifications or adjustment.
* Virtual machine configuration can be changed easily (e.g., adding new virtual disks or increasing RAM).
* Virtual machines are fully isolated from each other (file system, processes, sysctl variables) and the Virtuozzo host.
* A virtual machine can run any supported guest operating system. The guest OS and its applications are isolated inside a virtual machine and share physical hardware resources with other virtual machines.

Intel and AMD Virtualization Technology Support
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Virtuozzo provides support for Intel and AMD virtualization technologies comprising a set of processor enhancements and improving the work of virtualization solutions. Utilizing these technologies, Virtuozzo can offload some workload to the system hardware, which results in the "near native" performance of guest operating systems.

Virtual Machine Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Virtuozzo virtual machine works like a usual standalone computer.

By default, virtual machines are created with the following virtual hardware:

[options="compact"]
* 1 VirtIO SCSI HDD, expanding,
* 1 CD-ROM (IDE for Windows and Debian guests, VirtIO SCSI for Linux guests except Debian),
* 1 VirtIO network adapter, bridged,
* 32MB video card.

Other hardware added to a default VM may depend on the chosen distribution (see <<_creating_virtual_machines>>).

The complete range of virtual hardware a virtual machine can have is provided in the table below.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Some of the virtual hardware listed below may be unavailable in the current technical preview of Virtuozzo.
====

[cols="1a,2a"]
|====
|CPU|Up to 32 Intel/AMD CPUs
|RAM|Up to 128 GB of RAM
|Video Adapter|VGA/SVGA video adapter with VBE 3.0
|Video RAM|Up to 256 MB of video memory

====
* Generic SCSI device
|Network Interfaces|VirtIO (default), Intel 82545EM, or Realtek RTL8029 virtual network adapters.
|Serial (COM) Ports|Up to 4 serial (COM) ports mapped to a socket, a real port, or an output file
|Keyboard|Generic USB, PS/2 keyboard
|Mouse|Generic USB, PS/2 wheel mouse
|====

Virtual Machine Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A virtual machine has at least two files: a configuration file (PVS file) and a hard disk image file (HDD file). It can also have additional files: a file for each additional virtual hard disk and output files for virtual ports. By default, the virtual machines files are stored in the `/vz/vmprivate` directory on the Virtuozzo server.

The list of files related to a virtual machine is given in the table below:

[options="header",cols="1a,5a"]
|====
|File Name|Description

|`.pvm`|Bundle that contains the virtual machine files.
|`.pvs`|Virtual machine configuration file. It defines the hardware and resources configuration of the virtual machine. The configuration file is automatically generated during the virtual machine creation.
|`.sav`|Dump file created when you suspend the virtual machine. This file contains the state of the virtual machine and its applications at the moment the suspend was invoked.
|`.mem`|Memory dump file for the suspended virtual machine. For a running virtual machine, it is a temporary virtual memory file.
|`.hdd`|Hard disk image in QCOW2 format. When you create a virtual machine, you can create it with a new virtual hard disk or use an existing one. A virtual machine can have multiple hard disks.
|`.iso`|CD/DVD disc image. Virtual machines treat ISO images as real CD/DVD discs.
|`.txt`|Output files for serial ports. The output `.txt` files are generated when a serial port connected to an output file is added to the virtual machine configuration.
|====

Support of Virtual and Real Media
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section lists the types of disks that can be used by Virtuozzo virtual machines and provides the information about basic operations you can perform on these disks.

Supported Types of Hard Disks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Virtuozzo virtual machines can use only virtual hard disks image files as their hard disks.

Virtual Hard Disks
++++++++++++++++++

The capacity of a virtual hard disk can be set from 100 MB to 16 TB.

Virtual hard disks can be of either _plain_ or _expanding_ format. When you create a virtual machine in *Express Windows* or *Typical* mode (in the *New Virtual Machine* wizard), the disk is created in the _expanding_ format.

[options="header",cols="1a,5a"]
|====
|Type|Description

|*plain*|A plain virtual hard disk image file has a fixed size. The size is determined when the disk is created. Plain disks can be created with the help of New Virtual Machine wizard (the *Custom* mode.)
|*expanding*|An expanding virtual hard disk image file is small initially. Its size grows as you add applications and data to the virtual hard disk in the guest OS.
|====

Split disks
+++++++++++

A virtual disk of either format can be a single-piece disk or a split disk. A split disk is cut into 2 GB pieces and is stored as a single `.hdd` file.

CD/DVD Discs and Images
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Virtuozzo can access real CD/DVD discs and images of CD/DVD discs.

Virtuozzo has no limitations on using multi-session CD/DVD discs. A virtual machine can play back audio CDs without any limitations on copy-protected discs.

If your server has a recordable optical drive, you can use it to burn CD or DVD discs in a virtual machine.

Virtuozzo supports whatever CD/DVD disc images are supported by the guest OS.

Floppy Disks and Floppy Disk Images
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Virtuozzo can use two types of floppy disks:

[options="compact"]
* Real diskettes inserted into a real floppy disk drive that is connected to the virtual machine.
* Floppy disk image files having the `.fdd` extension and connected to the virtual machine.

Virtuozzo treats floppy disk images like real diskettes. Virtuozzo supports floppy disk image files that have the `.fdd` extension and are 1.44 MB in size.

With Virtuozzo, you can also create an image of a blank floppy using the *Floppy Disk* pane of the *Virtual Machine Configuration* dialog.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Virtuozzo cannot create images of real diskettes.
====

Virtuozzo Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo allows you to configure settings for the physical server in general and for each container in particular. Among these settings are disk and user quotas, network parameters, default file locations, sample configuration files, and other.

Virtuozzo stores all OS virtualization-related configuration information in the global configuration file `/etc/vz/vz.conf`. It defines container parameters like the default OS templates, disk quotas, logging, and so on.

The configuration file is read when the Virtuozzo software and/or containers are started. However, many settings can also be changed on the fly by means of Virtuozzo standard utilities like `prlctl`, with or without modifying the corresponding configuration file to keep the changes for the future.

Resource Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo resource management controls the amount of resources available to virtual machines and containers. The controlled resources include such parameters as CPU power, disk space, a set of memory-related parameters. Resource management allows you to:

[options="compact"]
* effectively share available physical server resources among virtual machines and containers
* guarantee Quality-of-Service in accordance with a service level agreement (SLA)
* provide performance and resource isolation and protect from denial-of-service attacks
* simultaneously assign and control resources for a number of virtual machines and containers
* collect usage information for system health monitoring

Resource management is much more important for Virtuozzo than for a standalone server since server resource utilization in such a system is considerably higher than that in a typical system.

Physical Server Availability Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The availability of a physical server running Virtuozzo is more critical than the availability of a typical PC server. Since it runs multiple virtual machines and containers providing a number of critical services, physical server outage might be very costly. It can be as disastrous as the simultaneous outage of a number of servers running critical services.

To increase physical server availability, we suggest that you follow the recommendations below:

[options="compact"]
* Use a RAID storage for critical virtual machines and containers. Do prefer hardware RAIDs, but software mirroring RAIDs might suit too as a last resort.
* Do not run any software on the server itself. Create special virtual machines and containers where you can host necessary services such as BIND, FTPD, HTTPD, and so on. On the server, you need only the SSH daemon. Preferably, it should accept connections from a pre-defined set of IP addresses only.
* Do not create users on the server itself. You can create as many users as you need in any virtual machine and container. Remember: compromising the server means compromising all virtual machines and containers as well.

Managing Virtual Machines and Containers
----------------------------------------

This chapter describes how to perform day-to-day operations on virtual machines and containers.

Creating Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains how to create new Virtuozzo virtual machines and containers. The options you should pass to this command differ depending on whether you want to create a virtual machine or container.

Choosing OS EZ Templates for Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before creating a container, you need to choose an OS EZ template it will be based on. To find out which OS EZ templates are already installed on the hardware node and cached (i.e. ready to be used), you can use the `vzpkg list` command. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzpkg list -O*
centos-6-x86_64                    2012-05-10 13:16:43
----

The timestamp next to an OS EZ template indicates when the template was cached.

Adding the `-O` option to the `vzpkg list` command, you can list only those OS EZ templates which are installed but not cached. You can also add the `--with-summary` option to display brief template descriptions:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzpkg list -O --with-summary*
centos-6-x86_64                    :CentOS 6 (for AMD64/Intel EM64T) EZ OS Template
----

Creating Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a container, use the `prlctl create` command as follows:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl create MyCT1 --vmtype ct*
----

Virtuozzo will create a new container with the name `MyCT1` using the default parameters from the global configuration file `/etc/vz/vz.conf`, including the operating system that will be installed in the container. All container contents will be stored in this container's private area. To find out where the private area is located, use the `prlctl list` command as follows:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list MyCT1 -i | grep "Home"*
Home: /vz/private/26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:*
[options="compact"]
. The first time you install an operating system in a container, its cache is created. To create a cache, you need to have an active Internet connection to access repositories that contain packages for the respective operating system. You can also set up a local package repository and use this repository to provide packages for your operating system. A local package repository is also required for some commercial distributions (e.g., for Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
. For information on creating containers with preinstalled applications, see <<_using_golden_image_functionality>>.
====

Creating Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creating a new virtual machine means creating a VM configuration based on a distribution you specified. To create VMs, use the `prlctl create` command. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl create MyVM --distribution win-2008 --vmtype vm*
----

This command creates a configuration for a virtual machine `MyVM`, adjusts it for running the Windows Server 2008 guest OS, and places all the required files in the +/vz/vmprivate/_&lt;VM_UUID&gt;_+ directory.

Once the virtual machine configuration is ready, you need to install a supported guest OS in it (Windows Server 2008 in this example) and can also install Virtuozzo guest tools. You can do this via:

[options="compact"]
* VNC (see <<_enabling_vnc_access_to_virtual_machines_and_containers>>) or
* Virtual Automation (may not work in the technical preview).

Supported Guest Operating Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following guest operating systems have been tested and are supported in virtual machines and containers.

Performing Initial Configuration of Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting your newly created virtual machine or container, you first need to configure it. This section describes the main configuration steps.

Installing Virtuozzo Guest Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtuozzo guest tools enable you to perform certain operations inside virtual machines from the host. These operations include:

[options="compact"]
* Running commands in VMs with the `prlctl exec` command.
* Setting passwords for specified users in VMs with the `prlctl set --userpasswd` command. If the specified user does not exist, it will be created.
* Obtaining and changing network settings for VMs.

The following sections describe how to install Virtuozzo guest tools in virtual machines running Linux and Windows guest operating systems.

Installing Virtuozzo Guest Tools in Linux Virtual Machines
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To install Virtuozzo guest tools in a Linux virtual machine `MyVM`, do the following:

. Run the `prlctl installtools` command on the Hardware Node. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl installtools MyVM*
----
+
The Virtuozzo guest tools image shipped with Virtuozzo will be mounted to the virtual machine's optical drive.

. Log in to the virtual machine.
. In the VM, create a mount point for the optical drive with the Virtuozzo guest tools image. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom*
----
. Run the installer. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# bash /mnt/cdrom/install*
----

Installing Virtuozzo Guest Tools in Windows Virtual Machines
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To install Virtuozzo guest tools in a Windows virtual machine `MyVM`, do the following:

. Run the `prlctl installtools` command on the Hardware Node. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl installtools MyVM*
----
+
The Virtuozzo guest tools image shipped with Virtuozzo will be mounted to the virtual machine's optical drive.

. Log in to the virtual machine.
. Install the VirtIO serial driver for your Windows version from +_&lt;CD_root&gt;_/vioserial/_&lt;Win_version&gt;_/amd64/vioser.inf+. You can do this by right-clicking the INF file and clicking Install in the context menu.
. From CD-ROM root, run the installers +prl_nettool_{zwsp}__&lt;Win_arch&gt;__.msi+ and +qemu-ga-_&lt;Win_arch&gt;_.msi+ for your Windows architecture.
. Make sure that the `QEMU-GA` (`qemu-ga.exe`) service is running.

Configuring Network Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make virtual machines and containers accessible from the network, you need to assign valid IP addresses to them and configure DNS servers. The session below illustrates setting these parameters for the virtual machine `MyVM` and the container `MyCT1`:

* Assigning IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net0 --ipadd 10.0.186.100/24*
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net0 --ipadd 1fe80::20c:29ff:fe01:fb07*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ipadd 10.0.186.101/24*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ipadd fe80::20c:29ff:fe01:fb08*
----
+
`net0` in the commands above denotes the network card in the virtual machine to assign the IP address to. You can view all network cards of a virtual machine using the `prlctl list <VM_name> -i` command.

* Setting DNS server addresses:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --nameserver 192.168.1.165*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --nameserver 192.168.1.165*
----
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:* 

[options="compact"]
. You can configure the network settings only for virtual machines that have Virtuozzo guest tools installed.
. To assign network masks to containers operating in the `venet0` network mode, you must set the `USE_VENET_MASK` parameter in the `/etc/vz/vz.conf` configuration file to `yes`.
====

Setting Passwords for Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Virtuozzo, you can use the `--userpasswd` option of the `prlctl set` command to create new accounts in your virtual machines and containers directly from the hardware node. The created account can then be used to log in to the virtual machine or container. The easiest way of doing it is to run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --userpasswd user1:2wsx123qwe*
----

This command creates the `user1` account in the container `MyCT1` and sets the `2wsx123qwe` password for it. Now you can log in to the container as `user1` and administer it in the same way you would administer a standalone server: install additional software, add users, set up services, and so on.

The `prlctl set` command can also be used to change passwords for existing accounts in your virtual machines and containers. For example, to change the password for `user1` in the container `MyCT1` to `0pi65jh9`, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --userpasswd user1:0pi65jh9*
----

When setting passwords for virtual machines and containers, keep in mind the following:

[options="compact"]
* You can use manage user accounts only inside virtual machines that have Virtuozzo guest tools installed.
* You should use passwords that meet the minimum length and complexity requirements of the respective operating system. For example, for Windows Server 2008, a password must be more than six characters in length and contain characters from three of the following categories: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, digits, and non-alphabetic characters.
* You should not create accounts with empty passwords for virtual machines and containers running Linux operating systems.

Setting Startup Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `prlctl set` command allows you to define the `onboot` startup parameter for virtual machines and containers. Setting this parameter to `yes` makes your virtual machine or container automatically boot at the physical server startup. For example, to enable the container `MyCT1` and the virtual machine `MyVM` to automatically start on your server boot, you can execute the following commands:

* For the container `MyCT1`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --onboot yes*
----
* For the virtual machine `MyVM`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --onboot yes*
----

Notice that the `onboot` parameter will have effect only on the next server startup.

Starting, Stopping, Restarting, and Querying Status of Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a virtual machine or container has been created, it can be managed like a usual computer.

Starting Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can start virtual machines and containers with the `prlctl start` command. For example:

* To start the container `MyCT1`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl start MyCT1*
----
* To start the virtual machine `MyVM`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl start MyVM*
----

Stopping Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can stop virtual machines and containers with the `prlctl stop` command. For example:

* To stop the container `MyCT1`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl stop MyCT1*
----
* To stop the virtual machine `MyVM`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl stop MyVM*
----

Restarting Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can restart virtual machines and containers with the `prlctl restart` command. For example:

* To restart the container `MyCT1`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl restart MyCT1*
----
* To restart the virtual machine `MyVM`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl restart MyVM*
----
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Restarting virtual machines requires a guest OS and Virtuozzo guest tools to be installed.
====

Checking Status of Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can check the status of a virtual machine or container with the `prlctl status` command. For example:

* To check the status of the container `MyCT1`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl status MyCT1*
CT MyCT1 exists running
----
* To check the status of the virtual machine `MyVM`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl status MyVM*
Vm MyVM exists stopped
----

Listing Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get an overview of the virtual machines and containers existing on the physical server and to get additional information about them--their IP addresses, hostnames, current resource consumption, and so on--use the `prlctl list` command. In the most general case, you can get a list of all virtual machines and containers by issuing the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -a*
UUID                                    STATUS    IP_ADDR        T   NAME
{600adc12-0e39-41b3-bf05-c59b7d26dd73}	running   10.10.1.101    CT  MyCT1
{b2de86d9-6539-4ccc-9120-928b33ed31b9}	stopped	  10.10.100.1	 VM  MyVM
----

The `-a` option tells the `prlctl list` command to output both running and stopped virtual machines and containers. By default, only running virtual machines and containers are shown. The default columns inform you of the container IDs and virtual machine names, the virtual machine or container status, type, IP addresses, and unique identifiers. This output can be customized as desired by using `prlctl list` command line options. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -a -o name,ctid*
NAME				UUID
MyCT1				{26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc}
MyVM				{b8cb6d99-1af1-453d-a302-2fddd8f86769}
----

This command displays only the names of existing virtual machines and containers and the IP addresses assigned to them.

Copying Virtual Machines and Containers within Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a complete copy of a particular virtual machine or container (in respect of all the virtual machine or container data and resources parameters), or a _clone_. This saves your time because you do not have to think of setting up the virtual machine or container configuration parameters and the like. Moreover, you can create a number of clones at a sitting.

In Virtuozzo, you can use the `prlctl clone` command to copy a virtual machine or container within the given physical server. To clone a container or a virtual machine, you need to stop it first. For example, you can create a clone of the container `MyCT1` and the virtual machine `MyVM` by running these commands:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl clone MyCT1 --name MyCT2*
*# prlctl clone MyVM --name ClonedVM*
----

The `--name` option specifies which name should be assigned to the new clone.

Checking the Cloned Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To check that your virtual machine or container has been successfully moved, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -a*
UUID            STATUS       IP_ADDR        T  NAME
{62951c2a-...}  stopped      10.0.10.101    CT MyCT1
{49b66605-...}  stopped      10.0.10.101    CT MyCT2
{7f4904ad-...}	stopped	     10.0.10.115    VM MyVM
{2afb2aa2-...}	stopped      10.30.128.134  VM ClonedVM
----

As you can see from the example above, container `MyCT2` and the `ClonedVM` virtual machine, the clones of the container `MyCT1` and virtual machine `MyVM` respectively, have been successfully created. However, before starting to use the clones, you should assign a different IP addresses to them which is currently identical to those of the container `MyCT1` and virtual machine `MyVM`. Refer to <<_performing_initial_configuration_of_virtual_machines_and_containers>> to learn how you can do it.

Configuring Default Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When cloning a virtual machine or container, you can also override the the following default directories:

* +/vz/vmprivate/_&lt;dest_VM_name&gt;_.pvm+ storing the files of a cloned virtual machine (where +_&lt;dest_VM_name&gt;_+ denotes the name of the resulting virtual machine). For example, for the `ClonedVM` virtual machine, this directory is `/vz/vmprivate/ClonedVM.pvm`. To store the files of the `ClonedVM` virtual machine in a custom directory, you can run the following command:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl clone MyVM --name ClonedVM --dst /customVMs*
----
+
In this case all virtual machine files will be placed to the `/customVMs` directory. Note that the specified directory must exist on the server; otherwise, the command will fail.

* default directory +/vz/private/_&lt;dest_UUID&gt;_+ defining the container private area (where +_&lt;dest_UUID&gt;_+ denotes the UUID of the resulting container). To define a custom private area path for the container `MyCT2`, you can execute the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl clone MyCT1 --name MyCT2 --dst /vz/private/customCTs*
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* The default `/vz/vmprivate` and `/vz/private` are valid for servers that do not participate in Virtuozzo storage clusters.
====

Suspending Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo allows you to suspend a running virtual machine or container on the physical server by saving its current state to a special file. Later on, you can resume the virtual machine or container and get it in the same state the virtual machine or container was at the time of its suspending. Suspending your virtual machines and containers may prove useful, for example, if you need to restart the physical server, but do not want to:

[options="compact"]
* quit the applications currently running in the virtual machine or container
* spend much time on shutting down the guest operating system and then starting it again

You can use the `prlctl suspend` command to save the current state of a virtual machine or container . For example, you can issue the following command to suspend the container `MyCT1`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl suspend MyCT1*
----

At any time, you can resume the container `MyCT1` by executing the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl resume MyCT1*
----

Once the restoration process is complete, any applications that were running in the container `MyCT1` at the time of its suspending will be running again and the information content will be the same as it was when the container was suspended.

Running Commands in Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo allows you to execute arbitrary commands inside virtual machines and containers by running them on the physical server, i.e. without the need to log in to the respective virtual machine or container. For example, this can be useful in these cases:

[options="compact"]
* If you do not know the virtual machine or container login information, but need to run some diagnosis commands to verify that it is operational.
* If the virtual machine or container has no network access.

In both cases, you can use the `prlctl exec` command to run a command inside the respective virtual machine or container. The session below illustrates the situation when you run the stopped SSH daemon inside a Linux virtual machine with the name of `My_Linux`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl exec My_Linux /etc/init.d/sshd status*
openssh-daemon is stopped
*# prlctl exec My_Linux /etc/init.d/sshd start*
Starting sshd: [  OK  ]
*# prlctl exec My_Linux /etc/init.d/sshd status*
openssh-daemon (pid 26187) is running...
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:* 

[options="compact"]
. You can use the `prlctl exec` command only inside virtual machines that have Virtuozzo guest tools installed.
. The `prlctl exec` command is executed inside a virtual machine or container from the `/` directory rather than from `/root`.
====

Deleting Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete a virtual machine or container that is not needed anymore using the `prlctl delete` command. Note that you cannot delete a running or mounted virtual machine or container. The example below illustrates deleting the running container `MyCT1`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl delete MyCT1*
Removing the CT...
Failed to remove the CT: Unable to complete the operation. This operation cannot \
be completed because the virtual machine "{4f27f27f-c056-4a65-abf6-27642b6edd21}"\
is in the "running" state.
*# prlctl stop MyCT1*
Stopping the CT...
The CT has been successfully stopped.
*# prlctl delete MyCT1*
Removing the CT...
The CT has been successfully removed.
----

Viewing Detailed Information About Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view detailed information about a virtual machine or container, you can use the `prlctl list -i` command. For example, the following command lists all information about the virtual machine `MyVM`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -i MyVM*
----

The following table describes the main options displayed by `prlctl list -i`.

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Option|Description

|`ID`|Virtual machine identifier. Usually, you use this ID, along with the virtual machine name, when performing an operation on the virtual machine.
|`EnvID`|Kernel virtual machine identifier. This is the ID the kernel on the physical server uses to refer to a virtual machine when displaying some information on this virtual machine.
|`Name`|Virtual machine name.
|`Description`|Virtual machine description.
|`State`|Virtual machine state.
|`OS`|Guest operating system installed in a virtual machine.
|`Uptime`|Time that shows for how long a virtual machine has been running since counter reset.
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* The uptime counter as well as count start date and time can be reset with the `prlctl reset-uptime` command.
====
|`Home`|Directory storing virtual machine files.
|`Guest tools`|Shows whether Virtuozzo guest tools are installed in a virtual machine.
|`Autostart`|Shows whether a virtual machine is automatically started when you turn on the physical server.
|`Boot order`|Order in which the virtual machine devices are checked for an operating system.
|`Hardware`|Devices available in a virtual machine.
|`Offline management`|Denotes whether the offline management feature is enabled for the virtual machine, and if yes, lists the available offline services.
|====

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* The options `prlctl list` displays for containers are similar to those for virtual machines.
====

Managing Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A template in Virtuozzo is a pre-configured virtual machine or container that can be easily and quickly deployed into a fully functional virtual machine or container. Like any normal virtual machine or container, a template contains hardware (virtual disks, peripheral devices) and the operating system. It can also have additional software installed. In fact, the only main difference between a virtual machine or container and a template is that the latter cannot be started.

In this technical preview, you can perform the following operations on templates:

[options="compact"]
* create a new template
* list existing templates
* create a virtual machine or container from a template

These operations are described in the following subsections in detail.

Creating Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Virtuozzo, you can create a template using the `prlctl clone` utility. Making a template may prove useful if you need to create several virtual machines or containers with the same configuration. In this case, your steps can be as follows:

[options="compact"]
. You create a virtual machine or container with the required configuration.
. You make a template on the basis of the created virtual machine or container.
. You use the template to create as many virtual machines or containers as necessary.

Let us assume that you want to create a template of the virtual machine `MyVM`. To do this, you can run the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl clone MyVM --name template1 --template*
----

This command clones the virtual machine and saves it as the `template1` template. After the template has been successfully created, you can use it for creating new virtual machines.

Listing Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, you may need to get an overview of the templates available on your hardware node. For example, this may be necessary if you plan to create a virtual machine or container from a specific template, but do not remember its exact name. In this case, you can use the `prlctl list` command to list all templates on the hardware node and find the one you need:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -t*
UUID                                    DIST            T  NAME
{017bfdf0-b546-4309-90d0-147ce55773f2}  centos          VM centos1_tmpl
{92cd331e-0572-46ac-8586-f19b8d029c4d}  centos          CT ct201_tmp1
{fc40e38e-8da4-4b26-bb18-6098ec85f7b4}  debian          VM deb7_tmpl
{0dea5912-b114-45a9-bd1a-dc065c1b8e9f}  ubuntu          VM ubuntu1_tmp1
{479e66aa-332c-4e3e-975e-b8b6bfc9d2e0}  win-2012        VM w12en_tmpl
----

In this example, 5 templates exist on the server. The information on these templates is presented in the form of a table with the following columns (from left to right): the template ID, the operating system contained in the template, the template type (for a container or virtual machine) and the template name.

Deploying Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To convert a template into a virtual machine or container, use the `--ostemplate` option  of the `prlctl create` command. For example, to convert the `template1` template to the `ConvertedVM` virtual machine, you can run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl create ConvertedVM --ostemplate template1*
----

To check that the virtual machine has been successfully created, use the `prlctl list -a` command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -a*
STATUS       IP_ADDR         NAME
running      10.12.12.101    MyVM
stopped      10.12.12.34     ConvertedVM
----

The template itself is left intact and can be used for creating other containers:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -t*
{4ad11c28-9f0e-4086-84ea-9c0487644026} win-2008	template1
{64bd8fea-6047-45bb-a144-7d4bba49c849} rhel	template2
----

Managing Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Virtuozzo, you can save the current state of a virtual machine or container by creating a snapshot. You can then continue working in your virtual machine or container and return to the saved state any time you wish. Snapshots may be useful in the following cases:

[options="compact"]
* Configuring applications with a lot of settings. You may wish to check how settings work before applying them to the application. So, before you start experimenting, you create a snapshot.
* Participating in large-scale development projects. You may wish to mark development milestones by creating a snapshot for each. If anything goes wrong, you can easily revert to the previous milestone and resume the development.

In Virtuozzo, you can create, list, revert to, and delete snapshots. These operations are described in the following subsections.

Creating Snapshots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a snapshot of a virtual machine or container, use the `prlctl snapshot` command.

Creating Virtual Machine Snapshots
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To create a snapshot of the virtual machine `MyVM`, do the following:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl snapshot MyVM*
...
The snapshot with ID {12w32198-3e30-936e-a0bbc104bd20} has been successfully created.
----

A newly created snapshot is saved to the +/vz/vmprivate/_&lt;VM_name&gt;_.pvm/Snapshots/_&lt;snapshot_ID&gt;_.pvs+ file, where +_&lt;VM_name&gt;_+ is the corresponding virtual machine name and +_&lt;snapshot_ID&gt;_+ is a unique snapshot ID. In the above example, the snapshot with ID `{12w32198-3e30-936e-a0bbc104bd20}` is saved to the file `/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/Snapshots/{12w32198-3e30-936e-a0bbc104bd20}.pvs`.

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# ls /vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/Snapshots/*
{063615fa-f2a0-4c14-92d4-4c935df15840}.pvc
----

Snapshot IDs are needed to switch to and delete snapshots.

When creating a snapshot, you can also set its name and description:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl snapshot MyVM -n Clean_System -d "This snapshot was created right after \
 installing Windows XP."*
...
The snapshot with ID {0i8798uy-1eo0-786d-nn9ic106b9ik} has been successfully created.
----

You can then view the set name and description in the `/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/Snapshots.xml` file.

Creating Container Snapshots
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To create a snapshot of the container `MyCT1`, do the following:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl snapshot MyCT1*
...
The snapshot with ID {08ddd014-7d57-4b19-9a82-15940f38e7f0} has been successfully \
created.
----

A newly created snapshot is saved to the +/vz/private/_&lt;UUID&gt;_/dump/_&lt;snapshot_ID&gt;_+ file, where +_&lt;UUID&gt;_+ is the container ID and +_&lt;snapshot_ID&gt;_+ is a snapshot ID. In the example above, the snapshot with ID `{08ddd014-7d57-4b19-9a82-15940f38e7f0}` is saved to the file `/vz/private/26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc/dump/{08ddd014-7d57-4b19-9a82-15940f38e7f0}`.

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# ls /vz/private/26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc/dump*
{08ddd014-7d57-4b19-9a82-15940f38e7f0}
----

Snapshot IDs are needed to switch to and delete snapshots.

When creating a snapshot, you can also set its name and description:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl snapshot MyCT1 --n Clean_System --d "This snapshot was created right after \
installing Windows XP."*
...
The snapshot with ID {e78bb2b8-7a99-4c8b-ab9a-491a47648c44} has been successfully \
created.
----

The set name and description are stored in the +/vz/private/_&lt;UUID&gt;_/Snapshots.xml+ file.

Snapshot Branching
++++++++++++++++++

Snapshot branches can be useful for working with, testing or comparing similar configurations. A snapshot branch is created when you do the following:

[options="compact"]
. Create several snapshots.
. Revert to one of the snapshots.
. Make changes to the virtual machine or container.
. Create a snapshot.

In this case, the newly created snapshot will start a new branch based on the snapshot from *Step 2*.

Restrictions and Recommendations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[options="compact"]
* Virtual machine and snapshot names and snapshot descriptions containing spaces must be enclosed in quotation marks (e.g., "Windows XP") when supplying them to the prlctl command.
* Before creating a snapshot, it is recommended that you finish any installations, downloads, and stop writing to external devices. You should also complete or cancel any transactions performed via the virtual machine in external databases.

Listing Snapshots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To list all snapshots of a particular virtual machine or container, use the `prlctl snapshot-list` command. For example, to check all current snapshots of the virtual machine `MyVM`, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl snapshot-list MyVM*
PARENT_SNAPSHOT_ID			 SNAPSHOT_ID
					 {989f3415-3e30-4494-936e-a0bbc104bd20}
{989f3415-3e30-4494-936e-a0bbc104bd20}	*{063615fa-f2a0-4c14-92d4-4c935df15840}
----

This command shows that the virtual machine `MyVM` has two snapshots. The snapshot with ID `{063615fa-f2a0-4c14-92d4-4c935df15840}` is based on the snapshot with ID `{989f3415-3e30-4494-936e-a0bbc104bd20}`, i.e. the former is a child of the latter. The asterisk marks the current snapshot.

To view the relationships between snapshots, use the `-t` option:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl snapshot-list MyVM -t*
&#095;{989f3415-3e30-4494-936e-a0bbc104bd20}&#095;{063615fa-f2a0-4c14-92d4-4c935df15840}\
*{712305b0-3742-4ecc-9ef1-9f1e345d0ab8}
----

The command output shows you that currently two branches exist for the virtual machine `MyVM`. The snapshot with ID `{989f3415-3e30-4494-936e-a0bbc104bd20}` is the base for these branches.

To get detailed information on a particular snapshot, use the `-i` option with the snapshot ID:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl snapshot-list MyVM -i {063615fa-f2a0-4c14-92d4-4c935df15840}*
ID: {063615fa-f2a0-4c14-92d4-4c935df15840}
Name: Clean_System
Date: 2012-07-22 22:39:06
Current: yes
State: poweroff
Description: &lt;![CDATA[This snapshot was created right after installing Windows 7]]&gt;
----

The `prlctl snapshot-list` command with the `-i` option displays the following information about snapshots:

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|====
|Field|Description

|`ID`|ID assigned to the snapshot.
|`Name`|Name assigned to the snapshot.
|`Date`|Date and time when the snapshot was created.
|`Current`|Denotes that this is the current snapshot of the virtual machine.
|`State`|State the virtual machine was in at the time you took the snapshot.
|`Description`|The description set for the snapshot.
|====

Reverting to Snapshots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To revert to a snapshot, use the `prlctl snapshot-switch` command. When you revert to a snapshot, the current state of the virtual machine or container is discarded, and all changes made to the system since the previous snapshot are lost. So, before reverting, you may want to save the current state by creating a new snapshot (see <<_creating_snapshots>>).

The `prlctl snapshot-switch` command requires the virtual machine or container ID and the snapshot ID as arguments, for example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl snapshot-switch MyVM --id {cedbc4eb-dee7-42e2-9674-89d1d7331a2d}*
----

In this example, you revert to the snapshot `{cedbc4eb-dee7-42e2-9674-89d1d7331a2d}` for the virtual machine `MyVM`.

Deleting Snapshots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To delete unneeded snapshots of virtual machines or containers, use the `prlctl snapshot-delete` command. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl snapshot-delete MyVM --id {903c12ea-f6e6-437a-a2f0-a1d02eed4f7e}*
----

When you delete a parent snapshot, child snapshots are not deleted, and the information from the former is merged into the latter.

Performing Container-specific Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides the description of operations specific to containers.

Reinstalling Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reinstalling a container may help if any required container files have been inadvertently modified, replaced, or deleted, resulting in container malfunction. You can reinstall a container by using the `prlctl reinstall` command that creates a new container private area from scratch according to its configuration file and relevant OS and application templates. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzctl reinstall MyCT1*
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* If any of the container application templates cannot be added to the container in a normal way, reinstallation will fail. This may happen, for example, if an application template was added to the container using the `--force` option of the `vzpkgadd` or `vzpkg install` command.
====

To keep the personal data from the old container, the utility also copies the old private area contents to the +/vz/root/_&lt;UUID&gt;_/old+ directory of the new private area (unless the `--skipbackup` option is given). This directory may be deleted after you copy the personal data where you need.

The `vzctl reinstall` command retains user credentials base, unless the `--resetpwdb` option is specified.

Customizing Container Reinstallation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default reinstallation, as performed by the `prlctl reinstall` command, creates a new private area for the broken container as if it were created by the `prlctl create` command and copies the private area of the broken container to the `/old` directory in the new private area so that no file is lost. There is also a possibility of deleting the old private area altogether without copying or mounting it inside the new private area, which is done by means of the `--skipbackup` option. This way of reinstalling corrupted containers might in certain cases not correspond exactly to your particular needs. It happens when you are accustomed to creating new containers in some other way than just using the `prlctl create` command. For example, you may install additional software licenses into new containers, or anything else. In this case you would naturally like to perform reinstallation in such a way so that the broken container is reverted to its original state as determined by you, and not by the default behavior of the `prlctl create` command.

To customize reinstallation, you should write your own scripts determining what should be done with the container when it is being reinstalled, and what should be configured inside the container after it has been reinstalled. These scripts should be named `vps.reinstall` and `vps.configure`, respectively, and should be located in the `/etc/vz/conf` directory on the hardware node. To facilitate your task of creating customized scripts, the containers software is shipped with sample scripts that you may use as the basis of your own scripts.

When the +prlctl reinstall _&lt;UUID&gt;_+ command is called, it searches for the `vps.reinstall` and `vps.configure` scripts and launches them consecutively. When the `vps.reinstall` script is launched, the following parameters are passed to it:

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|====
|Option|Description

|`--veid`|Container UUID.
|`--ve_private_tmp`|The path to the container temporary private area. This path designates where a new private area is temporarily created for the container. If the script runs successfully, this private area is mounted to the path of the original private area after the script has finished.
|`--ve_private`|The path to the container original private area.
|====

You may use these parameters within your `vps.reinstall` script.

If the `vps.reinstall` script finishes successfully, the container is started, and the `vps.configure` script is called. At this moment the old private area is mounted to the `/old` directory inside the new one irrespective of the `--skipbackup` option. This is done in order to let you use the necessary files from the old private area in your script, which is to be run inside the running container. For example, you might want to copy some files from there to regular container directories.

After the `vps.configure` script finishes, the old private area is either dismounted and deleted or remains mounted depending on whether the `--skipbackup` option was provided.

If you do not want to run these reinstallation scripts and want to stick to the default `prlctl reinstall` behavior, you may do either of the following:

[options="compact"]
* Remove the `vps.reinstall` and `vps.configure` scripts from the `/etc/vz/conf` directory, or at least rename them;
* Modify the last line of the `vps.reinstall` script so that it would read `exit 128` instead of `exit 0`.

The exit code `128` tells the utility not to run the scripts and to reinstall the container with the default behavior.

Enabling VPN for Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology which allows you to establish a secure network connection even over an insecure public network. Setting up a VPN for a separate container is possible via the TUN/TAP device. To allow a particular container to use this device, do the following:

. Make sure the `tun.o` module is already loaded before Virtuozzo is started:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# lsmod*
----
. Allow the container to use the TUN/TAP device:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzctl set MyCT1 --devices c:10:200:rw --save*
----
. Create the corresponding device inside the container and set the proper permissions:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl exec MyCT1 mkdir -p /dev/net*
*# prlctl exec MyCT1 mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200*
*# prlctl exec MyCT1 chmod 600 /dev/net/tun*
----

Configuring the VPN properly is a common Linux administration task, which is out of the scope of this guide. Some popular Linux software for setting up a VPN over the TUN/TAP driver includes http://vtun.sourceforge.net[Virtual TUNnel] and http://openvpn.sourceforge.net[OpenVPN].

Setting Up NFS Server in Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To set up an NFS server in a container, do the following:

. Make sure the `rpcbind`, `nfsd`, and `nfslock` services are installed in the container.
. Enable the NFS server feature for the container by running the `prlctl set --features nfsd:on` command on the hardware node. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --feature nfsd:on --save*
----
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* If the container is running, restart it for the changes to take effect.
====
. Start the `rpcbind` service in the container.
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# service rpcbind start*
Starting rpcbind:                                          [  OK  ]
----
. Start the `nfs` and `nfslock` services in the container.
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# service nfs start*
Starting NFS services:                                     [  OK  ]
Starting NFS quotas:                                       [  OK  ]
Starting NFS mountd:                                       [  OK  ]
Starting NFS daemon:                                       [  OK  ]
*# service nfslock start*
Starting NFS statd:                                        [  OK  ]
----

You can now set up NFS shares in the configured container.

Mounting NFS Shares on Container Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you configured an NFS share in the `/etc/fstab` file of a CentOS or RHEL-based container, and you need this NFS share to be mounted on container start, enable autostart for the `netfs` service with the `chkconfig netfs on` command.

Adding Multiple Virtual Disks to Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Even though new containers are created with just one virtual hard disk, you can add more disks to a container and keep the corresponding ploop images at locations of your choice, be it directly attached HDDs or SSDs or Virtuozzo storage. Such functionality allows creating more flexible containers, in which, for example, the operating system is kept on a fast SSD and user content is stored on a capacious HDD or Virtuozzo storage.

To add a virtual hard disk to a container, whether stopped or running, use the `prlctl set --device-add hdd` command. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --device-add hdd --image /hdd/MyCT1 --size 100G --mnt /userdisk*
----

This command adds to the configuration of the container `MyCT1` a virtual hard disk with the following parameters:

[options="compact"]
* name: +hdd_&lt;N&gt;_+ where +_&lt;N&gt;_+ is the next available disk index,
* image location: `/hdd/MyCT1`,
* size: 102400 MB,
* mount point inside the container `MyCT1`: `/userdisk`. A corresponding entry is also added to container's `/etc/fstab` file.

Performing Virtual Machine-specific Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section focuses on operations specific to virtual machines.

Pausing Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pausing a running virtual machine releases the resources, such as RAM and CPU, currently used by this virtual machine. The released resources can then be used by the hardware node or other running virtual machines and containers.

To pause a virtual machine, you can use the `prlctl pause` command. For example, the following command pauses the virtual machine `MyVM`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl pause MyVM*
Pause the VM...
The VM has been successfully paused.
----

You can check that the virtual machine has been successfully paused by using the `prlctl list -a` command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -a*
STATUS	IP_ADDR		NAME
running	10.10.10.101	MyCT1
paused	10.10.10.201	MyVM
----

The command output shows that the virtual machine `MyVM` is paused at the moment. To continue running this virtual machine, execute this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl start MyVM*
Starting the VM...
The VM has been successfully started.
----

Managing Virtual Machine Devices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtuozzo allows you to manage the following virtual machine devices:

[options="compact"]
* hard disk drives
* CD/DVD-ROM drives
* floppy disk drives
* network adapters
* serial ports
* USB controllers

The main operations you can perform on these devices are:

[options="compact"]
* adding a new device to the virtual machine
* configuring the device properties
* removing a device from the virtual machine

Adding New Devices
++++++++++++++++++

This section provides information on adding new devices to your virtual machines. You can add new virtual devices to your virtual machine using the `prlctl set` command. The options responsible for adding particular devices are listed in the following table:

[options="header",cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Option|Description

|`hdd`|Adds a new hard disk drive to the virtual machine. You can either connect an existing image to the virtual machine or create a new one.
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* IDE and SCSI disks can be added to stopped virtual machines only.
====
|`cdrom`|Adds a new CD/DVD-ROM drive to the virtual machine.
|`net`|Adds a new network adapter to the virtual machine.
|`fdd`|Adds a new floppy disk drive to the virtual machine.
|`serial`|Adds a new serial port to the virtual machine.
|`usb`|Adds a new USB controller to the virtual machine.
|====

For example, you can execute the following command to add a new virtual disk to the virtual machine `MyVM`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-add hdd*
Creating hdd1 (+) scsi:1 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk1.hdd&apos; type=&apos;expanded&apos;\ 
65536Mb subtype=virtio-scsi
Created hdd1 (+) scsi:1 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk1.hdd&apos; type=&apos;expanded&apos;\ 
subtype=virtio-scsi
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

This command creates a new virtual disk with the following default parameters:

[options="compact"]
* name: `hdd1`
* disk type: SCSI
* disk subtype: Virtio-SCSI
* image file name and location: `/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk1.hdd`
* disk format: expanded
* disk capacity: 65536 MB

You can redefine some of these parameters by specifying specific options during the command execution. For example, to create an IDE virtual disk that will have the capacity of 84 GB, you can run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-add hdd --size 84000 --iface ide*
Creating hdd2 (+) ide:0 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk2.hdd&apos; type=&apos;expanded&apos;\ 
84000Mb
Created hdd2 (+) ide:0 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk2.hdd&apos; type=&apos;expanded&apos;
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

The virtual disk has been added to your virtual machine. However, before starting to use it, you must initialize the disk. Refer to the next subsection for information on how you can do it.

When managing devices, keep in mind the following:

[options="compact"]
* You can connect up to 4 IDE devices, and 8 SCSI devices (virtual disks or CD/DVD-ROM drives) to a virtual machine.
* A virtual machine can have up to 16 virtual network adapters.
* A virtual machine can have up to 4 serial ports.
* A virtual machine can have only 1 USB controller.
* A virtual machine can have only 1 floppy disk drive.

Initialize a Newly Added Disk
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After you added a new blank virtual hard disk to the virtual machine configuration, it will be invisible to the operating system installed inside the virtual machine until the moment you initialize it.

*Initializing the New Virtual Hard Disk in Windows*

To initialize a new virtual hard disk in a Windows guest OS, you will need the Disk Management utility available. For example, in Windows Server 2012 you can access this utility by clicking *Start* > *Control Panel* > *System and Security* > *Administrative Tools* > *Computer Management* > *Storage* > *Disk Management*.

When you open the Disk Management utility, it automatically detects that a new hard disk was added to the configuration and launches the *Initialize Disk* wizard:

[options="compact"]
. In the *Select disks* section, select the newly added disk.
. Choose the partition style for the selected disk: MBR (Master Boot Record) or GPD (GUID Partition Table).
. Click *OK*.

The added disk will appear as a new disk in the Disk Management utility window, but its memory space will be unallocated. To allocate the disk memory, right-click this disk name in the Disk Management utility window and select *New Volume*. The *New Volume Wizard* window will appear. Follow the steps of the wizard and create a new volume in the newly added disk.

After that your disk will become visible in *My Computer* and you will be able to use it as a data disk inside your virtual machine.

*Initializing the New Virtual Hard Disk in Linux*

Initializing a new virtual hard disk in a Linux guest OS comprises two steps: (1) allocating the virtual hard disk space and (2) mounting this disk in the guest OS.

To allocate the space, you need to create a new partition on this virtual hard disk using the fdisk utility:

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* To use the `fdisk` utility, you need the `root` privileges.
====

. Launch a terminal window.
. To list the IDE disk devices present in your virtual machine configuration, enter:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
fdisk /dev/hd*
----
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* If you added a SCSI disk to the virtual machine configuration, use the `fdisk /dev/sd*` command instead.
====

. By default, the second virtual hard disk appears as `/dev/hdc` in your Linux virtual machine. To work with this device, enter:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
fdisk /dev/hdc
----
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* If this is a SCSI disk, use the `fdisk /dev/sdc` command instead.
====

. To get detailed information about the disk, enter:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
p
----

. To create a new partition, enter:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
n
----

. To create the primary partition, enter:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
p
----

. Specify the partition number. By default, it is 1.
. Specify the first cylinder. If you want to create a single partition on this hard disk, use the default value.
. Specify the last cylinder. If you want to create a single partition on this hard disk, use the default value.
. To create a partition with the specified settings, enter:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
w
----

When you allocated the space on the newly added virtual hard disk, you should format it by entering the following command in the terminal:

[subs="quotes"]
----
mkfs -t _&lt;FileSystem&gt;_ /dev/hdc1
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* +_&lt;FileSystem&gt;_+ stands for the file system you want to use on this disk. It is recommended to use `ext3` or `ext2`.
====

When the added virtual hard disk is formatted, you can mount it in the guest OS.

. To create a mount point for the new virtual hard disk, enter:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
mkdir /mnt/hdc1
----
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* You can specify a different mount point.
====

. To mount the new virtual hard disk to the specified mount point, enter:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
mount /dev/hdc1 /mnt/hdc1
----

When you mounted the virtual hard disk, you can use its space in your virtual machine.

Configuring Virtual Devices
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In Virtuozzo, you can use the `--device-set` option of the `prlctl set` command to configure the parameters of an existing virtual device. As a rule, the process of configuring the device properties includes two steps:

[options="compact"]
. Finding out the name of the device you want to configure.
. Running the prlctl set command to configure the necessary device properties.

*Finding Out Device Names*

To configure a virtual device, you need to specify its name when running the `prlctl set` command. If you do not know the device name, you can use the `prlctl list` command to learn it. For example, to obtain the list of virtual devices in the virtual machine `MyVM`, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list --info MyVM*
...
Hardware:
  cpu cpus=2 VT-x accl=high mode=32 ioprio=4 iolimit=&apos;0&apos;
  memory 1024Mb
  video 32Mb 3d acceleration=off vertical sync=yes
  fdd0 (+) real=&apos;/dev/fd0&apos; state=disconnected
  hdd0 (+) scsi:0 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd&apos; type=&apos;expanded&apos;\ 
subtype=virtio-scsi
  hdd1 (+) scsi:1 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk1.hdd&apos; type=&apos;expanded&apos;\ 
subtype=virtio-scsi
  cdrom0 (+) ide:1 real=&apos;Default CD/DVD-ROM&apos;
  usb (+)
  net0 (+) dev=&apos;vme426f6594&apos; network=&apos;Bridged&apos; mac=001C426F6594 card=virtio
...
----

All virtual devices currently available to the virtual machine are listed under `Hardware`. In our case the virtual machine `MyVM` has the following devices: 2 CPUs, main memory, video memory, a floppy disk drive, 2 hard disk drives, a CD/DVD-ROM drive, a USB controller, and a network card.

*Configuring Virtual Devices*

Once you know the virtual device name, you can configure its properties. For example, you can execute the following command to configure the current type of the virtual disk `hdd1` in the virtual machine `MyVM` from SCSI to IDE:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set hdd1 --iface ide*
Configured hdd1 (+) ide:0 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk1.hdd&apos; type=&apos;expanded&apos;
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

To check that the virtual disk type has been successfully changed, use the `prlctl list --info` command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list --info MyVM*
...
hdd1 (+) ide:0 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk1.hdd&apos; type=&apos;expanded&apos;
...
----

*Connecting and Disconnecting Virtual Devices*

In Virtuozzo, you can connect or disconnect certain devices when a virtual machine is running. These devices include:

[options="compact"]
* CD/DVD-ROM drives
* floppy disk drives
* network adapters
* printer ports
* serial ports
* USB devices
* shared folders

Usually, all virtual devices are automatically connected to a virtual machine when you create them. To disconnect a device from the virtual machine, you can use the `prlctl set` command. For example, the following command disconnects the CD/DVD-ROM drive `cdrom0` from the virtual machine `MyVM`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-disconnect cdrom0*
Disconnect device: cdrom0
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

To connect the CD/DVD-ROM drive back, you can run the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-connect cdrom0*
Connect device: cdrom0
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

Deleting Devices
++++++++++++++++

You can delete a virtual device that you do not need any more in your virtual machine using the `--device-del` option of the `prlctl set` command. The options responsible for removing particular devices are listed in the following table:

[options="header",cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Option|Description
|`hdd`|Deletes the specified hard disk drive from the virtual machine.
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* IDE and SCSI disks can be removed from stopped virtual machines only.
====
|`cdrom`|Deletes the specified CD/DVD-ROM drive from the virtual machine.
|`net`|Deletes the specified network adapter from the virtual machine.
|`fdd`|Deletes the floppy disk drive from the virtual machine.
|`serial`|Deletes the specified serial port from the virtual machine.
|`usb`|Deletes the USB controller from the virtual machine.
|====

As a rule deleting a virtual device involves performing two operations:

[options="compact"]
. Finding out the name of the device to be deleted.
. Deleting the device from the virtual machine.

*Finding Out the Device Name*

To remove a virtual device, you need to specify its name when running the `prlctl set` command. If you do not know the device name, you can use the `prlctl list` command to learn it. For example, to obtain the list of virtual devices in the `MyVM` virtual machine, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list --info MyVM*
...
Hardware:
  cpu cpus=2 VT-x accl=high mode=32 ioprio=4 iolimit=&apos;0&apos;
  memory 1024Mb
  video 32Mb 3d acceleration=off vertical sync=yes
  fdd0 (+) real=&apos;/dev/fd0&apos; state=disconnected
  hdd0 (+) scsi:0 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd&apos; type=&apos;expanded&apos;\ 
subtype=virtio-scsi
  hdd1 (+) ide:0 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk1.hdd&apos; type=&apos;expanded&apos;
  cdrom0 (+) ide:1 real=&apos;Default CD/DVD-ROM&apos;
  usb (+)
  net0 (+) dev=&apos;vme426f6594&apos; network=&apos;Bridged&apos; mac=001C426F6594 card=virtio
...
----

All virtual devices currently available to the virtual machine are listed under `Hardware`. In our case the virtual machine `MyVM` has the following devices: 2 CPUs, main memory, video memory, a floppy disk drive, 2 hard disk drives, a CD/DVD-ROM drive, a USB controller, and a network card.

*Deleting a Virtual Device*

Once you know the virtual device name, you can remove it from your virtual machine. For example, you can execute the following command to remove the virtual disk `hdd1` from the virtual machine `MyVM`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-del hdd1*
Remove the hdd1 device.
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

If you do not want to permanently delete a virtual device, you can temporarily disconnect if from the virtual machine using the `--disable` option.

Making Screenshots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Virtuozzo, you can use the `prlctl capture` command to capture an image (or screenshot) of your virtual machine screen. You can take screenshots of running virtual machines only. The session below demonstrates how to take a screenshot of the virtual machine `MyVM` screen and save it to the `/usr/screenshots/image1.png` file:

. Make sure that the virtual machine is running:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list*
STATUS	IP_ADDR		NAME
running	10.10.10.101	MyCT1
running	10.10.10.201 	MyVM
----

. Take the virtual machine screenshot:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl capture MyVM --file /usr/screenshots/image1.png*
----

. Check that the `image1.png` file has been successfully created:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# ls /usr/screenshots/*
image1.png
----

Assigning USB Devices to Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Virtuozzo, you can assign a USB device to a virtual machine so that the device is automatically connected to the virtual machine when you connect the USB device to the hardware node or start the virtual machine. To assign a USB device to a virtual machine, you need to specify two parameters:

* *ID of the USB device*. To get this information, use the `prlsrvctl info` command, for example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl info*
...
Hardware info:
	 hdd						&apos;/dev/sda&apos;
hdd-part NTFS						&apos;/dev/sda2&apos;
hdd-part Linux 						&apos;/dev/sda3&apos;
hdd-part Linux 						&apos;/dev/sda5&apos;
hdd-part Linux swap 					&apos;/dev/sda6&apos;
 cdrom Optiarc DVD RW AD-7260S                     &apos;/dev/scd0&apos;
  net enp0s5                                        &apos;enp0s5&apos;
  usb Broadcom - USB Device 3503                  &apos;2-1.4.3|0a5c|3503|full|KM|Empty&apos;
  sb Broadcom - USB Device 3502                   &apos;2-1.4.2|0a5c|3502|full|KM|Empty&apos;
  usb LITEON Technology - USB Multimedia Keyboard &apos;1-1.6|046d|c312|low|KM|Empty&apos;
  serial /dev/ttyS0					&apos;/dev/ttyS0&apos;
 serial /dev/ttyS1					&apos;/dev/ttyS1&apos;
----

All USB devices available on the hardware node are listed in the *Hardware info* section and start with `usb`.

* ID of the virtual machine. To get this information, use the `prlctl list --info` command, for example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list --info*
ID: {d8d516c9-dba3-dc4b-9941-d6fad3767035}
Name: Windows 7
...
----
+
The first line in the command output indicates the virtual machine ID; in our case, it is `{d8d516c9-dba3-dc4b-9941-d6fad3767035}`.

Once you know the USB device and virtual machine IDs, you can use the `prlsrvctl usb set` command to assign the USB device to the virtual machine. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl usb set &apos;1-1.6|046d|c312|low|KM|Empty&apos; {d8d516c9-dba3-dc4b-9941-\
d6fad3767035}*
The server has been successfully configured.
----

This command assigns the USB device +LITEON Technology - USB Multimedia Keyboard with ID &apos;1-1.6|046d|c312|low|KM|Empty&apos;+ to the virtual machine with ID `{d8d516c9-dba3-dc4b-9941-d6fad3767035}`. When running the command, remember to specify the single quotes and curly brackets with the USB device and virtual machine IDs, respectively.

To check that the USB device has been successfully assigned to the virtual machine, use the `prlsrvctl usb list` command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl usb list*
Broadcom - USB Device 3503		    &apos;2-1.4.3|0a5c|3503|full|KM|Empty&apos;
Broadcom - USB Device 3502		    &apos;2-1.4.2|0a5c|3502|full|KM|Empty&apos;
LITEON Technology - USB Multimedia Keyboard &apos;1-1.6|046d|c312|low|KM|Empty&apos; \
      {d8d516c9-dba3-dc4b-9941-d6fad3767035}
----

The command output shows that the USB device with ID +&apos;1-1.6|046d|c312|low|KM|Empty&apos;+ is now associated with the virtual machine with ID `{d8d516c9-dba3-dc4b-9941-d6fad3767035}`. This means that the device is automatically connected to the virtual machine every time you start this virtual machine and connect the device to the hardware node.

To remove the assignment of the USB device with ID +&apos;1-1.6|046d|c312|low|KM|Empty&apos;+, use the `prlsrvctl usb del` command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl usb del &apos;1-1.6|046d|c312|low|KM|Empty&apos;*
The server has been successfully configured.
----

When assigning USB devices to virtual machines, keep in mind the following:

[options="compact"]
* You cannot migrate a running virtual machine having one or more USB devices assigned.
* After migrating a stopped virtual machine, all its assignments are lost.
* All USB assignments are preserved if you restoring a virtual machine to its original location and are lost otherwise.
* The USB device assignment and a virtual machine is created for the user currently logged in to the system.

Configuring IP Address Ranges for Host-Only Networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All virtual machines connected to networks of the host-only type receive their IP addresses from the DHCP server. This DHCP server is set up during the Virtuozzo installation and includes by default IP addresses from 10.37.130.1 to 10.37.130.254. You can redefine the default IP address range for host-only networks and make virtual machines get their IP addresses from different IP address ranges. For example, you can run the following command to set the start and end IP addresses for the `Host-Only` network (this network is automatically created during the Virtuozzo installation) to 10.10.11.1 and 10.10.11.254, respectively:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl net set Host-Only --ip-scope-start 10.10.11.1 --ip-scope-end 10.10.11.254*
----

You can also specify a custom IP address range directly when creating a new network of the host-only type. Assuming that you want to create a network with the `Host-Only2` name and define for this network the IP addresses range from 10.10.10.1 to 10.10.10.254, you can execute the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl net add Host-Only2 -t host-only --ip-scope-start 10.10.10.1 --ip-scope-\
end 10.10.10.254*
----

When working with IP address ranges, pay attention to the following:

[options="compact"]
* The start and end IP addresses of an IP address range must belong to the same subnetwork.
* IP address ranges can be defined for each network of the host-only type separately. For example, you can set the IP address range from 10.10.11.1 to 10.10.11.254 for the `Host-Only` network and from 10.10.10.1 to 10.10.10.254 for the `Host-Only2` network.

Managing Resources
------------------

The main goal of resource control in Virtuozzo is to provide Service Level Management or Quality of Service for virtual machines and containers. Correctly configured resource control settings prevent serious impacts resulting from the resource over-usage (accidental or malicious) of any virtual machine or container on the other virtual machines and containers. Using resource control parameters for resource management also allows you to enforce fairness of resource usage among virtual machines and containers and better service quality for preferred virtual machines and containers, if necessary. All these parameters can be set using command-line utilities.

Managing CPU Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this technical preview, you can manage the following CPU resource parameters for virtual machines and containers:

[options="compact"]
* CPU units for virtual machines and containers
* CPU affinity for virtual machines and containers
* CPU limits for virtual machines and containers
* NUMA nodes for containers
* CPU hotplug for virtual machines

Detailed information on these parameters is given in the following sections.

Configuring CPU Units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CPU units define how much CPU time one virtual machine or container can receive in comparison with the other virtual machines and containers on the hardware node if all the CPUs of the hardware node are fully used. For example, if the container `MyCT1` and the virtual machine `MyVM` are set to receive 1000 CPU units each and the container `MyCT2` is configured to get 2000 CPU units, the container `MyCT2` will get twice as much CPU time as the container `MyCT1` or the virtual machine `MyVM` if all the CPUs of the Node are completely loaded.

By default, each virtual machine and container on the Node gets 1000 CPU units. You can configure the default setting using the `prlctl set` command. For example, you can run the following commands to allocate 2000 CPU units to the container `MyCT1` and the virtual machine `MyVM`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --cpuunits 2000*
*# prlctl set MyVM --cpuunits 2000*
----

Configuring CPU Affinity for Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your physical server has several CPUs installed, you can bind a virtual machine or container to specific CPUs so that only these CPUs are used to handle the processes running in the virtual machine or container. The feature of binding certain processes to certain CPUs is known as _CPU affinity_. Establishing CPU affinity between virtual machines and containers and physical processors may help you increase your system performance by up to 20%.

By default, any newly created virtual machine or container can consume the CPU time of all processors installed on the physical server. To bind a virtual machine or container to specific CPUs, you can use the `--cpumask` option of the `prlctl set` command. Assuming that your physical server has 8 CPUs, you can make the processes in the virtual machine `MyVM` and the container `MyCT1` run on CPUs 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 by running the following commands:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --cpumask 0,1,3,4-6*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --cpumask 0,1,3,4-6*
----

You can specify the CPU affinity mask--that is, the processors to bind to virtual machines and containers--as separate CPU index numbers (0,1,3) or as CPU ranges (4-6). If you are setting the CPU affinity mask for a running virtual machine or container, the changes are applied on the fly.

To undo the changes made to the virtual machine `MyVM` and the container `MyCT1` and set their processes to run on all available CPUs on the server, run these commands:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --cpumask all*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --cpumask all*
----

Configuring CPU Limits for Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A _CPU limit_ indicates the maximum CPU power a virtual machine or container may get for its running processes. The container is not allowed to exceed the specified limit even if the server has enough free CPU power. By default, the CPU limit parameter is disabled for all newly created virtual machines and containers. This means that any application in any virtual machine or container can use all the free CPU power of the server.

To set a CPU limit for a virtual machine or container, you can use one of these options: `--cpulimit`, `--cpus`. Both options are described below in detail.

Using --cpulimit to Set CPU Limits
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As a rule, you set a CPU limit for a virtual machine or container by using the `prlctl set --cpulimit` command. In the following example, the container `MyCT1` is set to receive no more than 25% of the server CPU time even if the CPUs on the server are not fully loaded:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --cpulimit 25*
----

This command sets the CPU limit for the container `MyCT1` to 25% of the total CPU power of the server. The total CPU power of a server in per cent is calculated by multiplying the number of logical CPU cores installed on the server by 100%. So if a server has 2 logical CPU cores, 2 GHz each, the total CPU power will equal 200% and the limit for the container `MyCT1` will be set to 500 MHz.

For example, on a hardware node with 2 logical CPU cores, 3 GHz each, the container `MyCT1` will be able to get 25% of 6 GHz, that is, 750 MHz. To ensure that the container `MyCT1` always has the same CPU limit on all servers, irrespective of their total CPU power, you can set the CPU limits in megahertz (MHz). For example, to make the container `MyCT1` consume no more than 500 MHz on any hardware node, run the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --cpulimit 500m*
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* For more information on setting CPU limits for containers, see also <<_cpu_limit_specifics>>.
====

Using --cpus to Set CPU Limits
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Another way of setting a CPU limit for a virtual machine or container is to use the `prlctl set --cpus` command. In this case, you can specify how many logical CPU cores the virtual machine or container may use. For example, to allow the container `MyCT1` to use only 2 cores, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --cpus 2*
----

To make sure that the CPU limit has been successfully set, you check `/proc/cpuinfo` in the container. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl exec MyCT1 cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "cpu cores"*
cpu cores       : 2
----

Using --cpulimit and --cpus Simultaneously
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you use both `--cpulimit` and `--cpus` to set the CPU limit for a virtual machine or container, the smallest limit applies. For example, running the following commands on a server with 4 CPUs, 2 GHz each, will set the limit for the container `MyCT1` to 2 GHz:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --cpus 2*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --cpulimit 2000m*
----

CPU Limit Specifics
+++++++++++++++++++

Internally, Virtuozzo sets the CPU limit for virtual machines and containers in percent. On multi-core systems, each logical CPU core is considered to have the CPU power of 100%. So if a server has 4 CPU cores, the total CPU power of the server equals 400%.

You can also set a CPU limit in megahertz (MHz). If you specify the limit in MHz, Virtuozzo uses the following formula to convert the CPU power of the server from MHz into percent: `CPULIMIT_% = 100% * CPULIMIT_MHz / CPUFREQ`, where

[options="compact"]
* `CPULIMIT_%` is the total CPU power of the server in percent.
* `CPULIMIT_MHz` is the total CPU power of the server in megahertz.
* `CPUFREQ` is the CPU frequency of one core on the server.

When setting CPU limits, note the following:

[options="compact"]
* Make sure that the CPU limit you plan to set for a virtual machine or container does not exceed the total CPU power of the server. So if a server has 4 CPUs, 1000 MHz each, do not set the CPU limit to more than 4000 MHz.
* The processes running in a virtual machine or container are scheduled for execution on all server CPUs in equal shares. For example, if a server has 4 CPUs, 1000 MHz each, and you set the CPU limit for a virtual machine or container to 2000 MHz, the virtual machine or container will consume 500 MHz from each CPU.
* All running virtual machines and containers on a server cannot simultaneously consume more CPU power than is physically available on the node. In other words, if the total CPU power of the server is 4000 MHz, the running virtual machines and containers on this server will not be able to consume more than 4000 MHz, irrespective of their CPU limits. It is, however, perfectly normal that the overall CPU limit of all virtual machines and containers exceeds the Node total CPU power because most of the time virtual machines and containers consume only part of the CPU power assigned to them.

Binding CPUs to NUMA Nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On systems with a NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) architecture, you can configure containers to use CPUs from specific NUMA nodes only. Let us assume the following:

[options="compact"]
* Your physical server has 8 CPUs installed.
* The CPUs are divided into 2 NUMA nodes: NUMA node 0 and NUMA node 1. Each NUMA node has 4 CPUs.
* You want the  processes in the container `MyCT1` to be executed on the processors from NUMA node 1.

To set the container `MyCT1` to use the processors from NUMA node 1, run the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzctl set MyCT1 --nodemask 1 --save*
----

To check that the container `MyCT1` is now bound to NUMA node 1, use this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzlist MyCT1 -o nodemask*
         NODEMASK
                1
----

To unbind the container `MyCT1` from NUMA node 1, execute this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzctl set MyCT1 --nodemask all --save*
----

Now the container `MyCT1` should be able to use all CPUs on the server again.

Enabling CPU Hotplug for Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a guest operating system supports the CPU hotplug functionality, you can enable this functionality for the virtual machine. Once the CPU hotplug functionality is turned on, you can increase the number of CPUs available to your virtual machines even if they are running.

Currently, the following systems come with the CPU hotplug support:

.Linux (both x86 and x64 versions)
[options="compact"]
* Linux operating systems based on the RHEL 5 kernel and higher (Red Hat Linux Enterprise 5, CentOS 5, and so on)

.Windows
[options="compact"]
* x64 version of Windows Server 2008 R2 (Datacenter Edition)
* x64 version of Windows Server 2012 (Standard and Datacenter Edition)
* x64 version of Windows Server 2008 (Standard Edition)
* x64 version of Windows Server 2008 (Enterprise Edition)
* x64 version of Windows Server 2008 (Datacenter Edition)

By default, the CPU hotplug support is disabled for all newly created virtual machines. To enable this functionality, you can use the `--cpu-hotplug` option of the `prlctl set` command. For example, to enable the CPU hotplug support in the virtual machine `MyVM` that runs one of the supported operating systems, stop the virtual machine `MyVM` and run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --cpu-hotplug on*
set cpu hotplug: 1
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

Once the functionality is enabled, you can increase the number of CPUs in the virtual machine `MyVM` even it is running. Assuming that your physical server has 4 CPUs installed and the processes in the virtual machine `MyVM` are set to be executed on two CPUs, you can run the following command to assign 3 CPUs to the virtual machine:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --cpus 3*
set cpus(4): 3
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

To disable the CPU hotplug support in the virtual machine `MyVM`, use this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --cpu-hotplug off*
set cpu hotplug: 0
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

The changes will come into effect on the next virtual machine start.

Managing Disk Quotas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can limit disk space that individual users and groups in a container can use with standard Linux tools from the `quota` package.

Before you can set disk quotas in a container, you will need to enable them for this container as follows:

. Set `QUOTAUGIDLIMIT` to `1` in container configuration file (+/etc/vz/conf/_&lt;UUID&gt;_.conf+) or run the command +prlctl set _&lt;UUID&gt;_ --quotaugidlimit 1+.
. Restart the container.

Managing Virtual Disks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Virtuozzo, you can manage virtual disks as follows:

[options="compact"]
* increase the capacity of your virtual disks,
* reduce the capacity of your virtual disks,
* compact virtual disks (reduce the size they occupy on the physical hard drive),
* change the type of your virtual disks (currently, virtual machines only),
* change the interface of your virtual disks.

All these operations are described in the following subsections in detail.

Changing Virtual Machine Disk Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A virtual disk can be one of the two types:

[options="compact"]
* `plain`. A plain virtual hard disk has a fixed size from the moment of its creation.
* `expanding`. An expanding virtual hard disk is small initially. Its size grows as you add applications and data to it.

A new virtual machine is created with an expanding virtual disk. However, when adding a new virtual disk to a virual machine you can set its type as plain using the `prlctl add --type` command. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-add hdd --type plain*
----

If you need to change the type of an existing virtual disk use the `prl_disk_tool` utility. Let us assume that the current type of the `hdd0` virtual disk in the virtual machine `MyVM` is expanding and you want to change it to plain. To do this, you can execute the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prl_disk_tool convert --hdd /vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd --plain*
----

Note that `prlctl` requires for its execution the disk name as it is shown by the `prlctl list --info` command (`hdd0`) while `prl_disk_tool` needs the full path to the virtual disk drive (`/vz/vmprivate/MyVM/harddisk.hdd`).

To change the disk type back to expanding, run one of the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prl_disk_tool convert --hdd /vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd --expanding*
----

Increasing Disk Capacity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you find that the capacity of the virtual hard disk of your virtual machine or container does not fit your needs anymore, you can increase it using the `prl_disk_tool resize --size` command. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prl_disk_tool resize --hdd /vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd --size 80G*
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* To virtual machines, additional disk space is added as unallocated. You can use standard means (e.g., the Disk Management tool in Windows-based virtual machines) to allocate added space by creating a new or expanding the existing partition.
====

When increasing the disk capacity, keep in mind the following:

[options="compact"]
* You cannot increase the capacity of a virtual disk used by a virtual machine if the virtual machine is running.
* The virtual machine using the virtual disk you want to configure must not have any snapshots. In this case, you should delete all existing snapshots and run the command again. To learn how to delete snapshots of a virtual machine, refer to <<_deleting_snapshots>>.
* The capacity of an expanding virtual disk shown from inside the virtual machine or container and the size the virtual disk occupies on the server's physical disk may differ.

Reducing Disk Capacity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtuozzo provides a possibility to reduce the size of an expanding virtual disk by setting the limit the disk cannot exceed. To do this, use the `prl_disk_tool resize --size` command. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prl_disk_tool resize --hdd /vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd --size 30G*
----

When reducing the disk capacity, keep in mind the following:

[options="compact"]
* You cannot reduce the capacity of a virtual disk used by a virtual machine if the virtual machine is running.
* The virtual machine using the virtual disk you want to configure must not have any snapshots. In this case, you should delete all existing snapshots and run the command again. To learn how to delete snapshots of a virtual machine, refer to <<_deleting_snapshots>>.
* The capacity of an expanding virtual disk shown from inside the virtual machine or container and the size the virtual disk occupies on the server's physical disk may differ.
* You cannot reduce XFS filesystems on LVM (the default choice for CentOS 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7).

Checking the Minimum Disk Capacity
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If, before reducing disk capacity, you want to know the minimum to which it can be reduced, use the `prl_disk_tool resize --info` command. For example, if the disk `hdd0` of the virtual machine `MyVM` is emulated by the image `/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd`, run the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prl_disk_tool resize --info --hdd /vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd*
Disk information:
...
Minimum: 2338M
...
----

Compacting Disks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Virtuozzo, you can decrease the space your virtual machines and containers occupy on the physical server's disk drive by compacting their virtual disks. Compacting virtual disks allows you to save your server's disk space and host more virtual machines and containers on the server.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Plain disks cannot be compacted.
====

To compact a virtual disk, you can use the `prl_disk_tool compact` command. For example, to compact the disk `/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd`, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prl_disk_tool compact --hdd /vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd/*
----

To check the space that was freed by compacting the virtual disk, you can use standard Linux utilities (for example, `df`).

Managing Virtual Machine Disk Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, any virtual machine is created with a SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) virtual hard disk. If necessary, you can change the interface type of a disk from SCSI to IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) or Virtio. For example, to change the interface type of the default disk (`hdd0`) in the virtual machine `MyVM` from SCSI to IDE, you can run the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set hdd0 --iface ide*
The VM has been successfully configured
----

To check that the interface type has been successfully changed, use this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -i MyVM | grep hdd0*
Boot order: hdd0 cdrom0 fdd0 net0
hdd0 (+) ide:0 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk.hdd&apos;
----

The command output shows that now the interface type of the `hdd0` disk is IDE.

You can create additional disks for the virtual machine `MyVM`. For example, to add a new disk of the IDE type to the virtual machine, execute the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-add hdd --iface ide*
Creating hdd1 (+) ide:1 image=&apos;/vz/vmprivate/MyVM.pvm/harddisk1.hdd&apos; 65536Mb
Create the expanding image file, 65536Mb...
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

You can also create a Virtio disk. To do this, specify `--iface virtio` instead of `--iface ide` in the command above. If you omit the `--iface` option, a SCSI disk is created by default.

The maximum number of devices (both virtual hard disks and CD/DVD-ROM drives) you can add to a virtual machine is given below:

[options="compact"]
* 4 IDE devices
* 8 SCSI devices

At any time, you can remove the `hdd1` disk from the virtual machine `MyVM`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-del hdd1*
Remove the hdd1 device.
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:* 
[options="compact"]
. Virtual IDE and SCSI disks can be added to or removed from stopped virtual machines only. 
. You need to initialize a newly added disk before you can start using it. To initialize the disk, use standard means provided by your guest operating system. 
====

Managing Network Accounting and Bandwidth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains how to perform the following tasks in Virtuozzo:

[options="compact"]
* configuring network classes
* viewing network traffic statistics
* turning on and off network bandwidth management
* configuring bandwidth limits

Network Traffic Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The table below summarizes the network traffic parameters that you can control in Virtuozzo.

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|====
|Parameter|Description

|`traffic_shaping`|If set to `yes`, traffic limitations for outgoing traffic are set for virtual machines and containers. The default is `no`.
|`bandwidth`|This parameter lists all network adapters installed on the hardware node and their bandwidth.
|`totalrate`|This parameter defines the bandwidth to allocate for each network class. It is active if traffic shaping is turned on.
|`rate`|If traffic shaping is turned on, this parameter specifies the bandwidth guarantee for virtual machines and containers.
|`ratebound`|If this parameter is set to `yes`, the bandwidth guarantee (the global rate parameter) is also the limit for the virtual machine or container, and the virtual machine or container cannot borrow the bandwidth from the `totalrate` bandwidth pool.
|====

Configuring Network Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtuozzo allows you to track the inbound and outbound network traffic as well as to shape the outgoing traffic for virtual machines and containers. To provide the ability to distinguish between types of traffic, e.g., domestic and international, a concept of network classes is introduced. A network class is a range of IP addresses for which Virtuozzo accounts and shapes the traffic.

Classes are specified in the `/etc/vz/conf/networks_classes` file. The file is in the ASCII format, and all empty lines and lines starting with the `#` sign are ignored. Other lines have the following format:

[subs="quotes"]
----
_&lt;class_id&gt; &lt;IP_address&gt;/&lt;prefix_length&gt;_
----

where +_&lt;class_id&gt;_+ defines the network class ID, and the +_&lt;IP_address&gt;/&lt;prefix_length&gt;_+ pair defines the range of IP addresses for this class. There may be several lines for each class.

Classes 0 and 1 have special meanings:

[options="compact"]
* Class 0 defines the IP address range for which no accounting is performed. Usually, it corresponds to the hardware node subnet (the node itself and its virtual machines and containers). Setting up class 0 is not required; however, its correct setup improves performance.
* Class 1 is defined by Virtuozzo to match any IP address. It must be always present in the network classes definition file. Therefore, it is suggested not to change the default line in the `networks_classes` file.
+
----
1 0.0.0.0/0
----
+
If your virtual machines and containers are using IPv6 addresses, you can also add the following line to this file:
+
----
1 ::/0
----

Other classes should be defined after class 1. They represent exceptions from the "matching-everything" rule of class 1. The example below illustrates a possible configuration of the network classes definition file containing rules for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:

----
# Hardware node networks
0 192.168.0.0/16
0 fe80::/64
# any IP address (all traffic)
1 0.0.0.0/0
1 ::/0
# class 2 - addresses for the "foreign" traffic
2 10.0.0.0/8
2 2001:db88::/64
# inside "foreign" network there
# is a hole belonging to "local" traffic
1 10.10.16.0/24
1 2001:db88:3333::/64
----

In this example, IPv4 addresses in the range of `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255` and IPv6 addresses in the range of `fe80::` to `fe80::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff` are treated as class 0 addresses and no accounting is done for the traffic from virtual machines and containers destined to these addresses.

Class 2 matches the following IP addresses:

[options="compact"]
* IPv4 addresses from `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255` with the exception of addresses in the sub-range of `10.10.16.0` to `10.10.16.255`, which are treated as class 1.
* IPv6 addresses from `2001:db88::` to `2001:db88::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff` with the exception of addresses in the sub-range of `2001:db88:3333::` to `2001:db88:3333::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`, which are also treated as class 1.

All other IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) belong to class 1.

To apply changes after editing the `/etc/vz/conf/networks_classes` file, restart either the virtual machine(s) or/and container(s) for which changes have been made or the hardware node itself if the changes are global.

Viewing Network Traffic Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Virtuozzo, you can view the current network traffic statistics for virtual machines and containers using the `vznetstat` utility. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vznetstat*
UUID         Net.Class	Input(bytes)  Input(pkts)  Output(bytes)  Output(pkts)
0            0          566093064     2800575      3120481        41736
47406484...  0 		67489         155 	   8033 	  110
fbb30afa-... 0          9369          78           12692          71
----

By default, `vznetstat` shows network statistics for both virtual machines and containers. Keep in mind that the `vznetstat` utility displays statistics only about virtual machines and containers that were started at least once.

The `vznetstat` utility displays the following information:

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|====
|Column|Description

|*UUID*|UUID assigned to virtual machine or container.
|*Net.Class*|ID of the network class for which network statistics is calculated.
|*Input(bytes)*|Amount of incoming traffic, in bytes.
|*Input(pkts)*|Amount of incoming traffic, in packets.
|*Output(bytes)*|Amount of outgoing traffic, in bytes.
|*Output(pkts)*|Amount of outgoing traffic, in packets.
|====

For example, from the command output above, you can see that around 9 MB of data were uploaded to the container `MyCT1`, (2) about 12 MB were downloaded from it, and all the traffic was exchanged with servers from class 0 networks.

If necessary, you can view network traffic statistics separately for virtual machine or container by passing the `-t` option to `vznetstat`:

* For containers only:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vznetstat -t ct*
CTID         Net.Class	Input(bytes)  Input(pkts)  Output(bytes)  Output(pkts)
0            0          566093064     2800575      3120481        41736
fbb30afa-... 0          9369          78           12692          71
----

* For virtual machines only:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vznetstat -t vm*
UUID         Net.Class	Input(bytes)  Input(pkts)  Output(bytes)  Output(pkts)
0            0          566093064     2800575      3120481        41736
47406484...  0 		67489         155 	   8033 	  110
----

You can also view network statistics for a particular virtual machine or container by specifying its ID after the `-v` option, for example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vznetstat -v fbb30afa-e770-4081-9d9e-6b9c262eb091*
UUID         Net.Class  Input(bytes)  Input(pkts)  Output(bytes)  Output(pkts)
fbb30afa-... 0          9369          78           12692          71
----

This command displays statistics only for the container `MyCT1`.

Configuring Traffic Shaping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Traffic shaping (also known as network bandwidth management) allows you to control what network bandwidth a virtual machine or container may use for outgoing traffic. This feature is disabled by default.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:*
[options="compact"]
. Traffic within a host cannot be shaped in the current version of Virtuozzo. This includes traffic between virtual machines and containers on the same host and betwen those and the host itself.
. Incoming traffic cannot be shaped for virtual machines and containers in the current version of Virtuozzo.
====

The following parameters control traffic shaping in Virtuozzo:

[options="compact"]
* `TRAFFIC_SHAPING`, enables and disables traffic shaping.
* `BANDWIDTH`, sets bandwidth for specific network adapters.
* `TOTALRATE`, sets the size of a bandwidth pool divided between virtual machines and contrainers on the host.
* `RATEMPU`, limits packet rate in addition to byte rate.
* `RATE`, sets a bandwidth guarantee for virtual machines and containers.
* `RATEBOUND`, forces `RATE` as a limit.

Traffic shaping in Virtuozzo works as follows. The bandwidth pool for a given network class (set by `TOTALRATE`) is divided among the virtual machines and containers transmitting data proportionally to their `RATE` settings. If the sum of `RATE` values of all virtual machines and containers transmitting data does not exceed `TOTALRATE`, each virtual machine or container gets the bandwidth equal to or greater than its `RATE` value (unless `RATEBOUND` is enabled for said virtual machine or container). If the sum of `RATE` values of all virtual machines and containers transmitting data exceeds the `TOTALRATE` value, each virtual machine or container may get less than its `RATE` value.

To enable and configure traffic shaping, do the following:

. Set the value of `TRAFFIC_SHAPING` to `yes` in the global configuration file `/etc/vz/vz.conf`.
. Set the parameters `BANDWIDTH`, `TOTALRATE` in `/etc/vz/vz.conf`.
. If required, set the optional parameters `RATEMPU`, `RATE`, `RATEBOUND` in `/etc/vz/vz.conf`.
. If required, set `RATE` and `RATEBOUND` for specific virtual machines and containers with `prlctl set --rate` and `prlctl set --ratebound` commands.
. To apply changes, restart either the virtual machines and containers for which changes have been made or the hardware node itself if the changes are global.

The following sections provide more details on and explain how to set traffic shaping parameters listed above.

Setting BANDWIDTH Parameter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `BANDWIDTH` parameter is used for shaping traffic of specific network adapters. For example, for two Fast Ethernet cards, a typical setting may look like `enp0s5 enp0s6:100000` where `enp0s5` and `enp0s6` are network adapter names. By default, the parameter is set to `100000` which corresponds to a 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet card.

Setting TOTALRATE Parameter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `TOTALRATE` parameter specifies the size of a bandwidth pool for specific network classes on the host. Virtual machines and containers can borrow bandwidth from the pool for communicating with hosts from the corresponding network class. The parameter thus limits the total available outgoing traffic for a network class that virtual machines and containers can consume.

The parameter is set as +__&lt;NIC&gt;__:__&lt;network_class&gt;__:__&lt;bandwidth_in_Kbps&gt;__+. For example, to set the pool size to 4 Mbps for network class 1 on the Ethernet adapter `enp0s5`, set `TOTALRATE` to `enp0s5:1:4000`. Multiple entries can be separated by spaces, e.g., `enp0s5:1:4000 enp0s6:2:8000`.

Setting RATEMPU Parameter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The optional `RATEMPU` parameter (where "MPU" stands for "minimum packet unit") limits the packet rate by making packets smaller than MPU in size consume HTB tokens. With it, small packets can be accounted as larger ones and limited by `TOTALRATE` and `RATE` parameters. Approximately, the maximum packets per second rate can be calculated as `TOTALRATE` / `RATEMPU`.

This parameter has the following syntax: +__&lt;NIC&gt;__:__&lt;network_class&gt;__[:__&lt;MPU_in_bytes_per_packet&gt;__]+. If the part +__&lt;MPU_in_bytes_per_packet&gt;__+ is omitted, the default value of 1000 bytes is used. Multiple entries can be separated by spaces, e.g., `enp0s5:1:2000 enp0s6:2:4000`. To set the `RATEMPU` parameter for all known Ethernet devices set +__&lt;NIC&gt;__+ to an asterisk (`*`). For example, to set the minimal packet size to 2 Kb for network class 1 on all the Ethernet adapters on the node, change the value to `*:1:2000`.

Setting RATE and RATEBOUND Parameters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The optional `RATE` parameter allows you to guarantee virtual machines and containers outgoing bandwidth to destinations in a specific network class on a specific Ethernet device. The guaranteed bandwidth is not a limit (unless the `RATEBOUND` parameter is also set to `on`, see below). A virtual machine or container can additionally obtain unused bandwidth from the bandwidth pool defined by `TOTALRATE`.

You can set the guaranteed bandwidth in two ways:

. For all virtual machines and containers on the host by setting `RATE` in the global configuration file `/etc/vz/vz.conf`.
+
The parameter is set as +__&lt;NIC&gt;__:__&lt;network_class&gt;__:__&lt;bandwidth_in_Kbps&gt;__+. For example, to guarantee all virtual machines and containers on the host the bandwidth of at least 8 Kbps for outgoing traffic in network class 1 on the Ethernet device `enp0s5`, set the `RATE` parameter to `enp0s5:1:8`.

. For specific virtual machines or containers by means of the `prlctl set --rate` command.
+
For example, to guarantee the container `MyCT1` the bandwidth of at least 16 Kbps for outgoing traffic in network class 1, run
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --rate 1:16*
----
+
This command sets the bandwidth for the default network adapter only. If you need to set bandwidth for other network adapters, set `RATE` in `/etc/vz/vz.conf`.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* It is recommended to increase `RATE` value in 8 Kbps increments and set it to at least 8 Kbps.
====

The optional `RATEBOUND` parameter specifies whether the network bandwidth guaranteed by `RATE` is also a limit. By default, this feature is disabled for all newly created virtual machines and containers so they may additionally obtain unused bandwidth from the pool set by `TOTALRATE`.

You can limit bandwidth of virtual machines and containers to the guaranteed value as follows:

. For all virtual machines and containers on the host by setting `RATEBOUND` in the global configuration file `/etc/vz/vz.conf` (omitted by default).
. For specific virtual machines or containers by means of the `prlctl set --ratebound` command. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ratebound yes*
----

If set, values of `RATE` and `RATEBOUND` provided for specific virtual machines and containers are chosen over global values in `/etc/vz/vz.conf`.

Traffic Shaping Example
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The example below illustrates a scenario when the containers `MyCT1` and `MyCT2` have `RATEBOUND` set to `no`, and the virtual machine `MyVM` has `RATEBOUND` set to `yes`. With the default `TOTALRATE` of 4096 Kbps and `RATE` of 8 Kbps, the bandwidth pool will be distributed as follows:

[options="header",cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|MyCT1|MyCT2|MyVM|Consumed Bandwidth

|transmits|idle|idle|MyCT1: 4096 Kbps
|idle|idle|transmits|MyVM: 8 Kbps
|transmits|transmits|idle|MyCT1: 2048 Kbps +
MyCT2: 2048 Kbps
|transmits|idle|transmits|MyCT1: 4032 Kbps +
MyVM: 8 Kbps
|transmits|transmits|transmits|MyCT1: 2016 Kbps +
MyCT2: 2016 Kbps +
MyVM: 8 Kbps

Managing Disk I/O Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains how to manage disk input and output (I/O) parameters in Virtuozzo systems.

Configuring Priority Levels for Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Virtuozzo, you can configure the disk I/O (input/output) priority level of virtual machines and containers. The higher the I/O priority level, the more time the virtual machine or container will get for its disk I/O activities as compared to the other virtual machines and containers on the hardware node. By default, any virtual machine or container on the hardware node has the I/O priority level set to 4. However, you can change the current I/O priority level in the range from 0 to 7 using the `--ioprio` option of the `prlctl set` command. For example, you can issue the following command to set the I/O priority of the container `MyCT1` and the virtual machine `MyVM` to 6:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ioprio 6*
*# prlctl set MyVM --ioprio 6*
----

To check the I/O priority level currently applied to the container `MyCT1` and the virtual machine `MyVM`, you can execute the following commands:

* For container `MyCT1`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# grep IOPRIO /etc/vz/conf/fbb30afa-e770-4081-9d9e-6b9c262eb091.conf*
IOPRIO="6"
----

* For the virtual machine `MyVM`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list MyVM --info | grep ioprio*
  cpu cpus=2 VT-x accl=high mode=32 ioprio=6 iolimit=&apos;0&apos;
----

Configuring Disk I/O Bandwidth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Virtuozzo, you can configure the bandwidth virtual machines and containers are allowed to use for their disk input and output (I/O) operations. Limiting the disk I/O bandwidth can help you prevent the situations when high disk activities in one virtual machine or container (generated, for example, by transferring huge amounts of data to/from the virtual machine or container) can slow down the performance of other virtual machines and containers on the hardware node.

By default, the I/O bandwidth limit for all newly created virtual machines and containers is set to 0, which means that no limits are applied to any virtual machines and containers. To limit the disk I/O bandwidth for a virtual machine or container, you can use the `--iolimit` option of the `prlctl set` command. For example, the following command sets the I/O bandwidth limit for the container `MyCT1` to 10 megabytes per second (MB/s):

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --iolimit 10*
----

By default, the limit is set in megabytes per second. However, you can use the following suffixes to use other measurement units:

[options="compact"]
* `G` sets the limit in gigabytes per second (1G).
* `K` sets the limit in kilobytes per second (10K).
* `B` sets the limit in bytes per second (10B).

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* In the current version of Virtuozzo, the maximum I/O bandwidth limit you can set for a virtual machine or container is 2 GB per second.
====

To check that the I/O speed limit has been successfully applied to the container `MyCT1`, use the `prlctl list` command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list MyCT1 -o iolimit*
IOLIMIT
10485760
----

At any time, you can remove the I/O bandwidth limit set for container `MyCT1` by running this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --iolimit 0*
----

Configuring the Number of I/O Operations Per Second
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Virtuozzo, you can limit the maximum number of disk input and output operations per second virtual machines and containers are allowed to perform (known as the IOPS limit). You may consider setting the IOPS limit for virtual machines and containers with high disk activities to ensure that they do not affect the performance of other virtual machines and containers on the Node.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* By default all I/O inside containers is cached and the direct access flag (`O_DIRECT`) is ignored when opening files. This significantly reduces the number of IOPS required for container workload and helps avoid I/O bottlenecks on the Node. For instructions on how to configure honoring of the `O_DIRECT` flag inside containers, see <<_setting_the_direct_access_flag_inside_containers>> below.
====

By default, IOPS is not limited for newly created virtual machines and containers. To set the IOPS limit, you can use the `--iopslimit` option of the `prlctl set` command. For example, to allow the container `MyCT1` and the virtual machine `MyVM` to perform no more than 100 disk I/O operations per second, you can run the following commands:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --iopslimit 100*
*# prlctl set MyVM --iopslimit 100*
----

To ensure that the IOPS limit has been successfully applied to the container `MyCT1` and the virtual machine `MyVM`, check the cgroup +/sys/fs/cgroup/beancounter/_<UUID>_/beancounter.iopslimit.speed+. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/beancounter/`vzlist MyCT1 -Ho uuid`/beancounter.iopslimit.speed*
100
----

At any time, you can remove the set IOPS limits by running this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --iopslimit 0*
*# prlctl set MyVM --iopslimit 0*
----

Setting the Direct Access Flag Inside Containers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can configure honoring of the `O_DIRECT` flag inside containers with the `sysctl` parameter `fs.odirect_enable`:

[options="compact"]
* To ignore the `O_DIRECT` flag inside a container, set `fs.odirect_enable` to `0` in that container.
* To honor the `O_DIRECT` flag inside the container, set `fs.odirect_enable` to `1` in that container.
* To have a container inherit the setting from the hardware node, set `fs.odirect_enable` to `2` in that container (default value). On the hardware node, `fs.odirect_enable` is `0` by default.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* The `fs.odirect_enable` parameter on the Node only affects honoring of the `O_DIRECT` flag in containers and not on the Node itself where the `O_DIRECT` flag is always honored.
====

Viewing Disk I/O Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this technical preview, you can view disk input and output (I/O) statistics for virtual machines and containers. To display the I/O statistics for all running virtual machines and containers on the physical server, you can run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzstat -a*
----

The information related to the virtual machines and containers disk I/O statistics is at the end of the command output. The table below explains the displayed I/O parameters:

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|====
|Parameter|Description

|`IOUSED%`|Percentage of time the disks are used by the virtual machine or container.
|`IOWAIT%`|Percentage of time when at least one I/O transaction in the virtual machine or container is waiting for being served.
|`IO`|I/O rate and limit, in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes per second.
|`IOPS`|I/O operations rate and limit, in operations per second.
|====

Managing Containers Memory Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the VSwap memory management system. You will learn to do the following:

[options="compact"]
* Configure the main VSwap parameters for containers.
* Set the memory allocation limit in containers.
* Configure OOM killer behavior.
* Enhance the VSwap functionality.

Configuring Main VSwap Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtuozzo utilizes the VSwap scheme for managing memory-related parameters in containers. Like many other memory management schemes used on standalone Linux computers, this scheme is based on two main parameters:

[options="compact"]
* `RAM` determines the total size of RAM that can be used by the processes of a container.
* `swap` determines the total size of swap that can be used by a container for swapping out memory once the RAM is exceeded.

The memory management scheme works as follows:

[options="compact"]
. You set for a container a certain amount of RAM and swap space that can be used by the processes running in the container.
. When the container exceeds the RAM limit set for it, the swapping process starts. The swapping process for containers slightly differs from that on a standalone computer. The container swap file is virtual and, if possible, resides in the Node RAM. In other words, when the swap-out for a container starts and the Node has enough RAM to keep the swap file, the swap file is stored in the Node RAM rather than on the hard drive.
. Once the container exceeds its swap limit, the system invokes the OOM Killer for this container.
. The OOM Killer chooses one or more processes running in the affected container and forcibly kills them.

By default, any newly created container starts using the new memory management scheme. To find out the amount of RAM and swap space set for a container, you can check the values of the `PHYSPAGES` and `SWAPPAGES` parameters in the container configuration file, for example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# grep PHYSPAGES /etc/vz/conf/26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc.conf*
PHYSPAGES="65536:65536"
*# grep SWAPPAGES /etc/vz/conf/26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc.conf*
SWAPPAGES="65536"
----

In this example, the value of the `PHYSPAGES` parameter for the container `MyCT1` is set to 65536. The `PHYSPAGES` parameter displays the amount of RAM in 4-KB pages, so the total amount of RAM set for the container `MyCT1` equals to 256 MB. The value of the `SWAPPAGES` parameter is also set to 256 MB.

To configure the amounts of RAM and swap space for the container `MyCT1`, use the `--memsize` and `--swappages` options of the `prlctl set` command. For example, you can execute the following command to set the amount of RAM and SWAP in the container `MyCT1` to 1 GB and 512 MB, respectively:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --memsize 1G --swappages 512M*
----

Configuring the Memory Allocation Limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an application starts in a container, it allocates a certain amount of memory for its needs. Usually, the allocated memory is much more than the application actually requires for its execution. This may lead to a situation when you cannot run an application in the container even if it has enough free memory. To deal with such situations, the VSwap memory management scheme introduces the new `vm_overcommit` option. Using it, you can configure the amount of memory applications in a container may allocate, irrespective of the amount of RAM and swap space assigned to the container.

The amount of memory that can be allocated by applications of a container is the sum of RAM and swap space set for this container multiplied by a memory overcommit factor. In the default (basic) container configuration file, this factor is set to 1.5. For example, if a container is based on the default configuration file and assigned 1 GB of RAM and 512 MB of swap, the memory allocation limit for the container will be 2304 MB. You can configure this limit and set it, for example, to 3 GB by running this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzctl set MyCT1 --vm_overcommit 2 --save*
----

This command uses the factor of 2 to increase the memory allocation limit to 3 GB: +
(1 GB of RAM + 512 MB of swap) * 2 = 3 GB

Now applications in the container `MyCT1` can allocate up to 3 GB of memory, if necessary.

Configuring OOM Killer Behavior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OOM killer selects container process (or processes) to end based on the badness reflected in +/proc/_&lt;pid&gt;_/oom_score+. The badness is calculated using process memory, total memory, and badness adjustment, and then clipped to the range from 0 to 1000. Each badness point stands for one thousandth of container memory. The process to be killed is the one with the highest resulting badness.

The OOM killer for container processes can be configured using the `/etc/vz/oom-groups.conf` file that lists patterns based on which badness adjustment is selected for each running process. Each pattern takes a single line and includes the following columns:

[options="compact"]
* +_&lt;command&gt;_+, mask for the task command name;
* +_&lt;parent&gt;_+, mask for the parent task name;
* +_&lt;oom_uid&gt;_+, task user identifier (UID) filter:
+
--
[options="compact"]
* If +_&lt;oom_uid&gt;_+ is -1, the pattern will be applicable to tasks with any UIDs,
* If +_&lt;oom_uid&gt;_+ is 0 or higher, the pattern will be applicable to tasks with UIDs equal to the +_&lt;oom_uid&gt;_+ value,
* If +_&lt;oom_uid&gt;_+ is less than -1, the pattern will be applicable to tasks with UIDs less than the negative +_&lt;oom_uid&gt;_+ value);
--
* +_&lt;oom_score_adj&gt;_+ badness adjustment. As with badness itself, each adjustment point stands for one thousandth of total container memory. Negative adjustment values reduce process badness. In an out-of-memory situation, an adjustment will guarantee that the process will be allowed to occupy at least +_&lt;oom_score_adj&gt;_+ thousandths of container memory while there are other processes with higher badness running in the container.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* The +_&lt;command&gt;_+ and +_&lt;parent&gt;_+ masks support wildcard suffixes: asterisk matches any suffix. E.g., "foo" matches only "foo", "foo*" matches "foo" and "foobar".
====

For example, the pattern

----
sshd     init     -500     -100
----

means that in an out-of-memory situation, `sshd`, a child of `init`, will be guaranteed at least 100 thousandths (i.e., 10%) of container memory, if its UID is less than -(-500) or just 500, e.g., 499. According to RHEL conventions, UIDs from 1 to 499 are usually reserved for system use, so such delimitation may be useful to prioritize and save system processes.

While calculating the badness of a process, the OOM killer searches `/proc/vz/oom_score_adj` for a suitable pattern based on masks and task UID filter. The search starts from the first line and ends when the first suitable pattern is found. The corresponding adjustment value is then used to obtain the resulting process badness.

The data from `/etc/vz/oom-groups.conf` is reset and committed to the kernel on boot. To reset and commit the config file manually, you can use the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# cat /etc/vz/oom-groups.conf &gt; /proc/vz/oom_score_adj*
----

Tuning VSwap
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The VSwap management scheme can be extended by using UBC parameters. For example, you can set the `numproc` parameter to configure the maximal number of processes and threads a container may create or the `numfile` parameter to specify the number of files that may be opened by all processes in the container.

Managing Virtual Machines Memory Parameters 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the process of managing memory parameters for virtual machines. You will learn how to do the following:

[options="compact"]
* Configure the main and video memory for virtual machines.
* Configure memory limits and quota for virtual machines.

Configuring Main Memory Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main memory resources for virtual machines include the following:

[options="compact"]
* main memory
* video memory

The process of managing these resources is described below.

Configuring Main Memory
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To configure the amount of memory that will be available to the virtual machine, use the `--memsize` option of the `prlctl set` command. The following session shows how to change the amount of memory for the virtual machine `MyVM` from 512 MB to 756 MB and to check that the new value has been successfully set:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -i MyVM | grep memory*
memory 512Mb
*# prlctl set MyVM --memsize 756*
Set the memsize parameter to 756Mb
The VM has been successfully configured.
*# prlctl list -i MyVM | grep memory*
memory 756Mb
----

You can configure the memory size for both running and stopped virtual machines.

Configuring Video Memory
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To set the amount of video memory to be available to the virtual machine's video card, use the `--videosize` option of the `prlctl set` command. Assuming that the current video memory size of the virtual machine `MyVM` is set to 32 MB, you can increase it to 64 MB by running the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --videosize 64*
----

To check that the new value has been successfully set, use this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -i MyVM | grep video*
video 64Mb
----

Configuring Additional Memory Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtuozzo 7 comes with an improved memory management scheme. This scheme is driven by two parameters:

[options="compact"]
* _Reserved memory limit_. The reserved memory limit defines the amount of memory on a hardware node that can be used by all virtual machines hosted on this node.
* _Memory quota_. The memory quota controls the memory consumption by a particular virtual machine. This parameter is composite and includes the guarantee, limit, priority, and ballooning settings.

The sections below describe how to configure both parameters.

Configuring the Reserved Memory Limit
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The reserved memory limit defines the amount of memory that can be consumed by all virtual machines on a hardware node. The remaining memory on the node is reserved for applications that run on the node itself.

By default, the reserved memory limit is calculated automatically and depends on the amount of memory installed on a hardware node:

[options="compact"]
* If the server has less than 3 GB of memory installed, this formula is used: "total RAM on the server" multiplied by 0.7. So if the server has 2 GB of memory, the reserved limit is set to 1.4 GB.
* If the server has more than 3 GB of memory installed, this formula is used: "total RAM on the server" minus 1 GB. So if the server has 16 GB of memory, the reserved limit is set to 15 GB.

To configure the default reserved memory limit, you can use the `--mem-limit` option of the `prlsrvctl set` command. For example, the following command reserves 14 GB of memory for use by virtual machines:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl set --mem-limit 14336*
Set memory limit: 14336Mb
The Server has been successfully configured.
----

To revert to the default settings, use this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl set --mem-limit auto*
Set memory limit: auto
The Server has been successfully configured.
----

Configuring the Memory Quota
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The memory quota allows you to control the memory consumption by a particular virtual machine. The quota control parameters include the following:

* _Guarantee_. The amount of memory a virtual machine is guaranteed to get on demand. If the virtual machine requests more memory than is guaranteed, the memory allocation may fail (for example, if there is no free memory on the hardware node at the moment). Moreover, if the guaranteed amount of memory of all virtual machines running on the server plus their overhead exceeds the reserved limit, you will not be able to start another virtual machine. By default, the guaranteed memory is calculated on the basis of RAM and video memory assigned to a virtual machine and is about a half of its total memory.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* The overhead of a virtual machine depends on its configuration. For example, the overhead of a virtual machine that has 1024 MB of RAM, 2 CPUs, 256 MB of video memory, a network adapter, and a USB controller and runs on modern hardware does not usually exceed 35-40 MB. To check the overhead of a running virtual machine, open the `/proc/parallels/vm/VM_ID/meminfo` file and look for the value of the `Unreclaimable` parameter. Keep in mind, however, that this value may change over time.
====
* _Limit_. The maximum amount of memory a virtual machine is allowed to consume. The virtual machine cannot exceed this limit even if the hardware node has a lot of free memory and the virtual machine requires this memory. By default, no limit is set for all newly created virtual machines, and any virtual machine may consume all free memory on the server.
* _Priority_. The priority (from 1 to 100) that defines which virtual machine will get memory first. The higher the priority of a virtual machine, the more chances it has to get memory when the hardware node has insufficient memory resources. By default, the priority is set to 50.
* _Ballooning_. The maximum amount of memory the balloon driver in a virtual machine may allocate for its needs. Memory ballooning is a technique that allows your system to reclaim memory from virtual machines. To do this, a special balloon driver is loaded into each running virtual machine. When the system requires free memory but does not have any, it sends a command to the balloon driver in the virtual machine to increase its size. The balloon driver inflates by allocating the requested amount of memory in the virtual machine and then gives this memory to the system.
+
By default, the balloon driver can allocate up to 60% of RAM set for a virtual machine. For example, if the amount of RAM for a virtual machine is set to 2 GB, the balloon driver can allocate the maximum of 1.2 GB of memory.

To configure these quota control parameters for a specific virtual machine, you can use the `--memquota` parameter of the `prlctl set` command. For example, the following command sets for the virtual machine `MyVM` the memory guarantee to 512 MB, the limit to 2 GB, the priority to 70, and the ballooning limit to 50% of RAM:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --memquota 512:2048:70:50*
Disable the memquota auto calculation.
Set the memquota_min parameter to 512Mb.
Set the memquota_max parameter to 2048Mb.
Set the memquota_prio parameter to 70.
Set the memquota_maxballoon parameter to 50.
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

To check that all parameters have been successfully set, use this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -i MyVM | grep memory_quota*
memory_quota min=512Mb max=2048Mb priority=70 maxballoon=50%
----

To revert to the default settings, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --memquota auto*
Enable the memquota auto calculation.
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

Possible Usage Scenarios
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Below you can find three examples that demonstrate how the new management scheme can help service providers optimize their business.

*Payable RAM*

You have a number of non-priority customers whose virtual machines use only a fraction of the RAM assigned to them. The virtual machines are stored on different physical servers. To optimize resource usage, you decide to migrate all underutilized virtual machines to one server. You then set (a) the guarantee for the migrated virtual machines to the minimum values recommended for the operating systems running in these virtual machines plus the virtual machine overhead and (b) the memory limit to their RAM values. In this scenario:

[options="compact"]
* You host a large number of virtual machines on a single physical server.
* You ensure that all virtual machines can get enough memory for non-intensive operations, but do not guarantee the optimal performance of memory-intensive operations (the limit is equal to the RAM).
* You charge customers for the amount of RAM assigned to their virtual machines.

*"What you pay is what you get" (payable guarantee and limit)*

You have a number of customers whose virtual machines require a certain amount of memory all the time. For these customers, you configure their virtual machines by setting the memory guarantee to the requested amount plus virtual machine overhead. You also set the memory limit equal to the guarantee. In this scenario:

[options="compact"]
* You charge customers for the set memory guarantee.
* Customers can get only the memory they pay for (the guarantee is equal to the limit).
* You ensure that every virtual machine can get the required amount of memory defined by its guarantee.
* No virtual machine can affect the performance of the host and other virtual machines on this host. To meet this requirement, you need to make sure that all virtual machines on the host are configured for use in the "What you pay is what you get" scenario.

*"Burstable memory" (payable guarantee)*

You have a number of customers whose virtual machines consume small amounts of memory most of the time. Sometimes, memory-intensive operations may also run in the virtual machines. For these virtual machines, you set the memory guarantee to the values that are high enough to run non-intensive memory operations and the memory limit to "unlimited". In this scenario:

[options="compact"]
* You charge customers for the set memory guarantee.
* You ensure that all virtual machines can get enough memory for non-intensive operations, and such operations are running in the affected virtual machines most of the time.
* When virtual machines require more memory than is defined by their guarantee, they get free memory available on the host (the limit is set to "unlimited"). If the host does not have enough memory, the virtual machines start competing for free memory.

Managing Container Resources Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any container is configured by means of its own configuration file. You can manage container configurations in a number of ways:

. Using configuration sample files shipped with Virtuozzo. These files are used when a new container is being created (for details, see <<_virtuozzo_containers>>). Currently, the following configuration sample files are provided:
+
--
[options="compact"]
* `basic` for creating standard containers.
* `confixx` for creating containers that are to run the Confixx control panel.
* `vswap.plesk` for creating containers with the Plesk control panel.
* `vswap.256MB` for creating containers with 256 MB of main memory.
* `vswap.512Mb` for creating containers with 512 MB of main memory.
* `vswap.1024Mb` for creating containers with 1024 MB of main memory.
* `vswap.2048Mb` for creating containers with 2048 MB of main memory.
--
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Configuration sample files cannot contain spaces in their names.
====
+
Any sample configuration file can also be applied to an existing container. You would do this if, for example, you want to upgrade or downgrade the overall resources configuration of a particular container:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --applyconfig basic*
----
+
This command applies all the parameters from the `ve-basic.conf-sample` file to the container `MyCT1`. When you install Virtuozzo on your hardware node, the default container samples are put to the `/etc/vz/conf` directory. They have the following format: +ve-_&lt;name&gt;_.conf-sample+ (for example, `ve-basic.conf-sample`).

. Using specific utilities for preparing configuration files in their entirety. The tasks these utilities perform are described in the following subsections of this section.
. The direct creating and editing of the corresponding container configuration file (+/etc/vz/conf/_&lt;UUID&gt;_.conf+). This can be performed with the help of any text editor. The instructions on how to edit container configuration files directly are provided in the four preceding sections. In this case you have to edit all the configuration parameters separately, one by one.

Splitting Server Into Equal Pieces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the `vzsplit` command, you can create configurations for containers that would take a specific fraction of the hardware node resources. For example, to create a configuration `myconf` for up to 20 containers:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzsplit -n 20 -f myconf*
Config /etc/vz/conf/ve-myconf.conf-sample was created
----

The configuration is calculated based on the hardware node resources. You can now use the `--config myconf` option of the `prlctl create` command to create containers based on this configuration.

Applying New Configuration Samples to Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtuozzo allows you to change the configuration sample file a container is based on and, thus, to modify all the resources the container may consume and/or allocate at once. For example, if the container `MyCT1` is currently based on the `basic` configuration sample and you are planning to run the Plesk application inside the container, you may wish to apply the `vswap.plesk` sample to it instead of `basic`, which will automatically adjust the necessary container resource parameters for running the Plesk application inside the container `MyCT1`. To do this, you can execute the following command on the hardware node:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --applyconfig vswap.plesk*
----

This command reads the resource parameters from the `ve-vswap.plesk.conf-sample` file located in the `/etc/vz/conf` directory and applies them one by one to the container `MyCT1`.

When applying new configuration samples to containers, keep in mind the following:

[options="compact"]
* All container sample files are located in the `/etc/vz/conf` directory on the hardware node and are named according to the following pattern: +ve-_&lt;name&gt;_.conf-sample+. You should specify only the +_&lt;name&gt;_+ part of the corresponding sample name after the `--applyconfig` option (`vswap.plesk in the example above).
* The `--applyconfig` option applies all the parameters from the specified sample file to the given container, except for the `OSTEMPLATE`, `TEMPLATES`, `VE_ROOT`, `VE_PRIVATE`, `HOSTNAME`, `IP_ADDRESS`, `TEMPLATE`, `NETIF` parameters (if they exist in the sample file).

You may need to restart your container depending on the fact whether the changes for the selected parameters can be set on the fly or not. If some parameters could not be configured on the fly, you will be presented with the corresponding message informing you of this fact.

Managing Virtual Machine Configuration Samples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration of a virtual machine is defined by its `config.pvs` configuration file. This file in XML format is automatically created when you make a new virtual machine and contains all parameters of the virtual machine: memory, CPU, disk space, and so on.

Once a virtual machine is created, you can manually configure its parameters using the `prlctl` utility. However, if you need to configure multiple parameters for several virtual machines, this may become a tedious task. To facilitate your work, you can create virtual machine samples and use them to quickly and easily change the configuration of virtual machines. You can even further simplify the configuration process by creating a virtual machine template and several sample files. In this case, you can quickly make a new virtual machine on the basis of your template and apply the desired configuration file to it.

Creating a Configuration Sample
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you can start using virtual machine configuration samples, you need to create at least one configuration sample. The easiest way of doing this is to follow the steps below:

. Create a virtual machine configuration, for example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl create VmConfiguration*
----
. Set the parameters for the virtual machine configuration as you want them to be. For example, you can use the `prlctl set` command to set the required amount of memory and disk space. All your parameters are saved to the `config.pvs` file of the `VmConfiguration` virtual machine.
+
For the list of parameters that can be applied from a configuration sample, see <<_parameters_applied_from_configuration_samples>> below.
. Copy the `config.pvs` file to the `/etc/parallels/samples` directory. If this directory does not exist, create it:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# mkdir /etc/parallels/samples*
*# cp /vz/vmprivate/VmConfiguration/config.pvs /etc/parallels/samples/configMySQL.pvs*
----
The latter command copies the `config.pvs` file to the `configMyDB.pvs` file.

Applying Configuration Samples to Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you have created the configuration sample, you can apply it to any of your virtual machines. You can do this using the `--applyconfig` option with the `prlctl set` command and specifying the sample name without the `.pvs` extension. For example, to apply the `configMySQL` sample to the `VM1` virtual machine, you can run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set VM1 --applyconfig configMySQL*
----

You can apply configuration samples to stopped virtual machines only.

Parameters Applied from Configuration Samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following parameters are applied to a virtual machine from a new configuration sample:

[options="compact"]
* All memory-related parameters (both RAM and video). To view these parameters in a sample file, locate the +&lt;Memory&gt;+ and +&lt;Video&gt;+ elements.
* All CPU-related parameters. To view these parameters in a sample file, locate the +&lt;Cpu&gt;+ element.
* IO and IOPS parameters. To view these parameters in a sample file, locate the +&lt;IoLimit&gt;+ and +&lt;IopsLimit&gt;+ elements, respectively.
* Disk space parameter. To view this parameter in a sample file, locate the +&lt;Size&gt;+ element enclosed in the +&lt;Hdd&gt;+ element:

[subs="quotes"]
----
&lt;Hdd id=0" dyn_lists="Partition 0"&gt;
&lt;Index&gt;0&lt;/Index&gt;
&lt;Size&gt;65536&lt;/Size&gt;
&lt;/Hdd&gt;
----

The virtual disk to which the value of the +&lt;Size&gt;+ element is applied is defined by the index number in the +&lt;Index&gt;+ element. For example, in the example above, the disk space parameter (65536 MB) is applied to the virtual disk with index number 0. If the virtual machine does not have a virtual disk with the specified index, the parameter is ignored.

Monitoring Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Virtuozzo, you can use the `vzstat` utility to monitor system resources in real time. When executed, the utility displays the status and load of the system: its disk, network, CPU, memory, and other parameters. It also provides the list of running virtual machines and containers together with their resources consumption statistics. For example, you can run the following command on the server to view your current system resources:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzstat -d 5*
 12:47pm, up  1:32,  2 users, load average: 0.00, 0.04, 0.05

----

The command output is updated with the time interval equal to the value specified after the `-d` (delay) option measured in seconds. In the session above, the statistics displayed is renewed every five seconds. If the `-d` option is not specified, the default interval equals 1 second.

As you can see, the utility provides real-time information on all main resources subsystems pertaining both to the physical server and to its virtual machines and containers: the disk, network, CPU, and memory subsystems. You may want to shrink the output of the utility by specifying the `-b` (brief) option instead of `-v` (verbose), or to do without any options to use the "normal" mode of displaying.

The following information is displayed by default per each virtual machine or container:

[options="header",cols="1,4"]
|====
|Column|Description

|*ST*|Virtual machine or container status. If there are no failed counters and the latency values are normal, the status is "OK". Otherwise, it is displayed in red as "!!". You can sort virtual machines and containers by their status to see the problem virtual machines and containers first.
|*%VM*|Virtual memory usage, in per cent to the total memory. The first number is how much virtual memory is being used, and the second one is the virtual memory barrier.
|*%KM*|Kernel memory usage, in per cent to the normal zone size. The first number is how much kernel memory is being used, and the second one is the kernel memory barrier.
|*CPU*|CPU usage in per cent to all available CPUs. The first number is how much of the CPU power is being used by the virtual machine or container, and the second one is its guaranteed share judging by the `cpuunits` parameter. Note that the actual CPU usage may be higher than the guaranteed one.
|*FCNT*|The number of failed counters for all the resource parameters. In the standard mode of displaying, this number represents the increase of failed counters since the previous screen update, whereas in the average mode of displaying, it represents an absolute failed counters sum for the given virtual machine or container.
|*MLAT*|Maximal scheduling latency for the virtual machine or container, in ms. This parameter shows the maximal scheduling latency inside the given virtual machine or container, i.e. for how long (at the utmost) a process inside the virtual machine or container awaits for the CPU.
|*NAME*|Virtual machine or container name.
|====

The *%VM*, *%KM*, and *CPU* columns provide two values per column separated by a slash for each virtual machine and container. The first value indicates the real usage of the corresponding parameter by the virtual machine or container, and the second one--the maximal value allowed for the virtual machine or container.

Managing Services and Processes
-------------------------------

This chapter provides information on what services and processes are, how they influence the operation and performance of your system, and what tasks they perform in the system.

You will learn how to use the command line utilities in order to manage services and processes in Virtuozzo. In particular, you will learn how to monitor active processes in your system, change the mode of the `xinetd`-dependent services, identify the container UUID where a process is running by the process ID, start, stop, or restart services and processes, and edit the service run levels.

What Are Services and Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instances of any programs currently running in the system are referred to as processes. A process can be regarded as the virtual address space and the control information necessary for the execution of a program. A typical example of a process is the _vi_ application running on your server or inside your Linux-based containers. Along with common processes, there are a great number of processes that provide an interface for other processes to call. They are called services. In many cases, services act as the brains behind many crucial system processes. They typically spend most of their time waiting for an event to occur or for a period when they are scheduled to perform some task. Many services provide the possibility for other servers on the network to connect to the given one via various network protocols. For example, the `nfs` service provides the NFS server functionality allowing file sharing in TCP/IP networks.

You may also come across the term "daemon" that is widely used in connection with processes and services. This term refers to a software program used for performing a specific function on the server system and is usually used as a synonym for "service". It can be easily identified by `d` at the end of its name. For example, `httpd` (HTTP daemon) represents a program that runs in the background of your system and waits for incoming requests to a web server. The daemon answers the requests automatically and serves the hypertext and multimedia documents over the Internet using HTTP.

When working with services, you should keep in mind the following. During the lifetime of a service, it uses many system resources. It uses the CPUs in the system to run its instructions and the system's physical memory to hold itself and its data. It opens and uses files within the file systems and may directly or indirectly use certain physical devices in the system. Therefore, in order not to decrease your system performance, you should run only those services on the hardware node that are really needed at the moment.

Besides, you should always remember that running services in the Host OS is much more dangerous than running them in virtual machines and containers. In case violators get access to one of the virtual machines and containers through any running service, they will be able to damage only the virtual machine or container where this service is running, but not the other virtual machines and containers on your server. The hardware node itself will also remain unhurt. And if the service were running on the hardware node, it would damage both the server and all virtual machines and containers residing on it. Thus, you should make sure that you run only those services on the server that are really necessary for its proper functioning. Launch all additional services you need at the moment inside separate virtual machines and containers. It can significantly improve your system safety.

Main Operations on Services and Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ability to monitor and control processes and services in your system is essential because of the profound influence they have on the operation and performance of your whole system. The more you know about what each process or service is up to, the easier it will be to pinpoint and solve problems when they creep in.

The most common tasks associated with managing services running on the hardware node or inside a virtual machine or container are starting, stopping, enabling, and disabling a service. For example, you might need to start a service in order to use certain server-based applications, or you might need to stop or pause a service in order to perform testing or to troubleshoot a problem.

For `xinetd`-dependent services, you do not start and stop but enable and disable services. The services enabled in this way are started and stopped on the basis of the corresponding state of the `xinetd` daemon. Disabled services are not started whatever the `xinetd` state.

In Virtuozzo, you can manage services on the hardware node and inside containers by means of special Linux command-line utilities. You can do it either locally or from any server connected on the network.

As for processes, such Virtuozzo utilities as `vzps`, `vztop`, `vzpid` enable you to see what a process is doing and to control it. Sometimes, your system may experience problems such as slowness or instability, and using these utilities can help you improve your ability to track down the causes. It goes without saying that in Virtuozzo you can perform all those operations on processes you can do in a normal system, for example, kill a process by sending a terminate signal to it.

Managing Processes and Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Virtuozzo, services and processes can be managed using the following command-line utilities:

[options="compact"]
* `vzps`
* `vzpid`
* `vztop`

With their help, you can perform the following tasks:

[options="compact"]
* print the information about active processes on your hardware node
* view the processes activity in real time
* change the mode of the services that can be either `xinetd`-dependent or standalone
* identify the container UUID where a process is running by the process ID

Viewing Active Processes and Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `vzps` utility provides certain additional functionality related to monitoring separate containers running on the hardware node. For example, you can use the `-E` switch with the `vzps` utility to:

[options="compact"]
* display the container UUIDs where the processes are running
* view the processes running inside a particular container

`vzps` prints the information about active processes on your hardware node. When run without any options, `vzps` lists only those processes that are running on the current terminal. Below is an example output of `vzps`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzps*
  PID TTY         TIME CMD
 4684 pts/1   00:00:00 bash
27107 pts/1   00:00:00 vzps
----

Currently, the only processes assigned to the user/terminal are the `bash` shell and the `vzps` command itself. In the output, the PID (Process ID), TTY, TIME, and CMD fields are contained. TTY denotes which terminal the process is running on, TIME shows how much CPU time the process has used, and CMD is the name of the command that started the process.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* The IDs of the processes running inside containers and displayed by running the `vzps` command on the hardware node does not coincide with the IDs of the same processes shown by running the `ps` command inside these containers.
====

As you can see, the standard `vzps` command just lists the basics. To get more details about the processes running on your server, you will need to pass some command line arguments to `vzps`. For example, using the `aux` arguments with this command displays processes started by other users (`a`), processes with no terminal or one different from yours (`x`), the user who started the process and when it began (`u`).

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzps aux*
USER  PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ  RSS TTY   STAT START  TIME COMMAND
root    1  0.0  0.0  1516  128 ?     S   Jul14   0:37 init
root    5  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?     S   Jul14   0:03 [ubstatd]
root    6  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?     S   Jul14   3:20 [kswapd]
#27     7  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?     S   Jul14   0:00 [bdflush]
root    9  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?     S   Jul14   0:00 [kinoded]
root 1574  0.0  0.1   218  140 pts/4 S   09:30   0:00 -bash
----

There is a lot more information now. The fields *USER*, *%CPU*, *%MEM*, *VSZ*, *RSS*, *STAT*, and *START* have been added. Let us take a quick look at what they tell us.

The *USER* field shows you which user initiated the command. Many processes begin at system start time and often list root or some system account as the user. Other processes are, of course, run by actual users.

The *%CPU*, *%MEM*, *VSZ*, and *RSS* fields all deal with system resources. First, you can see what percentage of the CPU the process is currently utilizing. Along with CPU utilization, you can see the current memory utilization and its VSZ (virtual memory size) and RSS (resident set size). VSZ is the amount of memory the program would take up if it were all in memory. RSS is the actual amount currently in memory. Knowing how much a process is currently eating will help determine if it is acting normally or has spun out of control.

You will notice a question mark in most of the TTY fields in the `vzps aux` output. This is because most of these programs were started at boot time and/or by initialization scripts. The controlling terminal does not exist for these processes; thus, the question mark. On the other hand, the `bash` command has a TTY value of pts/4. This is a command being run from a remote connection and has a terminal associated with it. This information is helpful for you when you have more than one connection open to the machine and want to determine which window a command is running in.

STAT shows the current status of a process. In our example, many are sleeping, indicated by an S in the STAT field. This simply means that they are waiting for something. It could be user input or the availability of system resources. The other most common status is R, meaning that it is currently running.

You can also use the `vzps` command to view the processes inside any running container. The example below shows you how to display all active processes inside the container `MyCT1` with UUID 26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc:

Monitoring Processes in Real Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `vztop` utility is rather similar to `vzps` but is usually started full-screen and updates continuously with process information. This can help with programs that may infrequently cause problems and can be hard to see with `vzps`. Overall system information is also presented, which makes a nice place to start looking for problems.

The `vztop` utility can be run on the server just as the standard Linux `top` utility. The only features that distinguish the `vztop` utility from `top` are the following:

[options="compact"]
* `vztop` allows you to use the `-E` option that monitors only the processes belonging to the container whose processes you want to display.
* You can press `e` to temporarily view/hide the UUIDs where the processes are running.
* You can press `E` to set the filter on the UUID field that helps you display only the processes belonging to the given container.

The `vztop` utility usually has an output like the following:

[subs="quotes"]

As you can see, `vztop` provides an ongoing look at the processor activity in real time (the display is updated every 5 seconds by default, but you can change that with the `d` command-line option or by pressing *s*. It displays a list of the most CPU-intensive tasks on the system and can provide an interactive interface for manipulating processes. It can sort the tasks by CPU usage, memory usage, and runtime. Specifying `MyCT1` after the `-E` option allows you to display only those processes that are running inside the container `MyCT1` only. Besides, most features can be selected by an interactive command, for example, `e` and `E` described above.

Determining Container UUIDs by Process IDs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each process is identified by a unique PID (process identifier), which is the entry of that process in the kernel's process table. For example, when you start Apache, it is assigned a process ID. This PID is then used to monitor and control this program. The PID is always a positive integer. In Virtuozzo, you can use the `vzpid` (retrieve process ID) utility to print the container UUID the process with the given id belongs to. Multiple process IDs can be specified as arguments. In this case the utility will print the container number for each of the processes.

The typical output of the `vzpid` utility is shown below:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzpid 12*
Pid               VEID    Name
14663     26bc47f6-...    init
----

In our example the process with the identifier 14663 has the name `init` and is running in the container with UUID 26bc47f6-{skipped}.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* You can also display the container UUID where the corresponding process is running by using the `vzps` utility.

Managing Virtuozzo Network
--------------------------

The given chapter familiarizes you with the Virtuozzo network structure, lists networking components, and explains how to manage these components in your working environments. In particular, it provides the following information:

[options="compact"]
* How you can manage network adapters on the hardware node.
* What virtual networks are and how you can manage them on the hardware node.
* How to create virtual network adapters inside your virtual machines and containers and configure their parameters.
* How to connect virtual machines and containers to different networks.

Managing Network Adapters on the Hardware Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network adapters installed on the hardware node are used to provide virtual machines and containers with access to each other and to external networks. During the installation, Virtuozzo registers all physical network adapters available on the server. Once Virtuozzo has been successfully installed, you can manage network adapters on the hardware node using native RHEL7 utilities.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* You can also use VLAN interfaces instead of physical.
====

Networking Modes in Virtuozzo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes networking modes available in Virtuozzo.

In Virtuozzo, any virtual machine or container can operate in one of the two networking modes: host-routed or bridged.

Container Network Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes bridged and host-routed network modes for containers.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* IPSec connections inside containers are supported.
====

Host-Routed Mode for Containers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, a new container starts operating in the host-routed mode. In this mode, the container uses a special network adapter, `venet0`, to communicate with the server where it resides, with the other containers on the server, and with computers on external networks. The figure below demonstrates an example network configuration where all containers are set to work in the host-routed mode.

image::images/container_venet_mode.png[align="center"]

In this configuration:

* Containers #1, #2, and #3 use the `venet0` adapter as the default gateway to send and receive data to/from other networks. They also use this adapter to exchange the traffic between themselves.
* When containers #1, #2, and #3 start, the server creates ARP and routing entries for them in its ARP and routing tables. You can view the current ARP and routing entries on a server using the `arp -n` and `route -n` commands. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# arp -n*

192.168.200.102   *               255.255.255.255 UH    1000   0        0 venet0
192.168.200.103   *               255.255.255.255 UH    1000   0        0 venet0

default           parallels.com   0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 enp0s5
----
+
As you can see, the ARP and routing tables contain entries about IP addresses 192.168.200.101, 192.168.200.102, and 192.168.200.103 that belong to containers #1, #2, and 3#.

* All container outgoing network traffic goes to the `venet0` adapter and is forwarded via the `enp0s5` physical adapter to the destination, according to the routing table of the server.
* All container incoming network traffic is also processed by the `venet0` adapter. Consider the following situation:
+
--
[options="compact"]
. *Computer X* on the local network wants to send a data packet to container #1 with IP address 192.168.200.101, so it issues an ARP request which computer has this IP address.
. The server hosting container #1 replies with its MAC address.
. *Computer X* sends the data packet to the indicated MAC address.
. The server receives the packet and transmits it to `venet0` that forwards the packet to container #1.
--

Bridged Mode for Containers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default network adapter of a container can operate in the host-routed mode only. You can, however, create additional virtual adapters in containers and make them operate in the bridged network mode. The following figure shows an example network configuration where containers #1 and #2 are set to work in the bridged mode.

image::images/veth_mode_cts.png[align="center"]

In this configuration:

* Container #1 and container #2 have separate virtual adapters consisting of two network interfaces:
+
--
[options="compact"]
* An +enp__<X>__s__<Y>__+ interface in the container (*enp0s5* in the figure). This interface represents a counterpart of a physical network adapter installed on a standalone server. Like any other physical adapter, it has a MAC address, can be assigned one or more IP addresses, included in different networks, and so on.
* A `veth` interface on the hardware node (*veth26bc47f6.1* and *vethcdb87d9e.1* in the figure). This interface is mostly used to maintain the communication between the hardware node and Ethernet interfaces in containers.
--
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* To simplify things, virtual adapters operating in the bridged mode are called `veth` adapters, though it is not quite correct from the technical point of view.
====
+
Both interfaces are closely linked to each other, so a data packet entering one interface always comes out from the other one.

* Containers #1 and #2 keep their own ARP and routing tables that they consult when sending or receiving data.
* The `veth` adapters of both containers are bridged through the bridge `br0` to the physical network adapter `enp0s5`.
* All container outgoing traffic comes via the `veth` adapters to the bridge and are then transmitted through the `enp0s5` physical adapter to the destination, according to the routing tables stored in the containers.
* All incoming data packets for container #1 and #2 reach the `enp0s5` physical adapter first and are then sent through the bridge to the `veth` adapter of the destination container.

Virtual Machine Network Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes bridged and host-routed network modes for virtual machines.

Bridged Mode for Virtual Machines
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, a new virtual machine is created with a network adapter that operates in the bridged mode. The figure below demonstrates an example network configuration where two virtual machines, VM #1 and VM #2, are configured to work in the bridged mode.

image::images/vm_bridged_mode.png[align="center"]

In this configuration:

* Each virtual machine has a separate virtual adapter that exposes two interfaces: (1) an `ethX` interface in the virtual machine (`eth0` in the figure) and a `vme` interface on the server (`vme7b9a73a1` and `vme4980d06a` in the figure). Both interfaces are closely linked to each other, which means that an IP packet entering one interface always comes out of the other one. An eth adapter has a MAC address, can be assigned one or more IP addresses, belong to different network environments, and so on.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* To simplify things, virtual adapters operating in the bridged mode are called vme adapters, though it is not quite correct from the technical point of view.
====

* VM #1 and VM #2 keep their own ARP and routing tables that they consult when sending or receiving data.
* The virtual adapters of both virtual machines are bridged through the bridge `br0` to the physical network adapter `eth0`.
* All outgoing data packets are sent from the virtual machines through the bridge and `eth0` physical adapter to the destination, according to their routing tables.
* All incoming data packets for VM #1 and VM #2 reach the eth0 physical adapter first and are then transmitted through the bridge to the vme interface of the destination virtual machine.

Host-Routed Mode for Virtual Machines
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The other network mode a virtual machine can work in is the host-routed mode. The figure below demonstrates an example network configuration where two virtual machines, VM #1 and VM #2, are set to operate in the host-routed mode.

image::images/host_routed_vm.png[align="center"]

In this configuration:

* Each virtual machine also has a virtual adapter exposing two interfaces: an `eth` interface in the virtual machine and a `vme` interface on the server.
* Unlike the bridged mode, the ARP entries for VM #1 and VM #2 are stored on the server rather than in the virtual machines themselves. The server creates these ARP entries and saves them to its ARP table when VM #1 and VM #2 start. You can use the `arp -n` command to view the current ARP entries on a server, for example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
# arp -n
Address		HWtype	HWaddress		Flags Mask	Iface
10.30.0.4	ether	00:1a:e2:c7:17:c1	C		eth0
10.30.23.162	ether	70:71:bc:42:f6:a0	C		eth0
192.168.200.201	*	*			MP		eth0
192.168.200.202	*	*			MP		eth0
----

* Along with ARP entries, the server also creates routing entries for both virtual machines. So when the server receives a data packet destined for IP address 192.168.200.201, it knows that the packet must be forwarded to the `vme7b9a73a1` interface of VM #1.
* The server handles all incoming traffic for both virtual machines. Consider the following situation:
+
--
[options="compact"]
. *Computer X* on the network wants to send a data packet to VM #1 with IP address 192.168.200.201, so it issues an ARP request which computer has this IP address.
. The server replies with its own MAC address.
. *Computer X* sends the data packet to the indicated MAC address.
. The `eth0` physical adapter receives the packet and routes it to the `vme7b9a73a1` interface of VM #1.
--
* All outgoing network traffic sent from VM #1 and VM #2 are routed through the default gateway to the `enp0s5` adapter on the server. The default gateway for host-routed virtual machines is automatically assigned the IP address of 169.255.30.1. This special IP address is taken from the Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) range and used exclusively to deliver data packets from virtual machines to the server.

Differences Between Host-Routed and Bridged Network Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The bridged network mode demonstrates a number of differences as compared to the host-routed one:

[options="compact"]
* Each `veth` virtual adapter has a MAC address assigned to it while a host-routed adapter does not have any. Thanks to this fact:
+
--
[options="compact"]
* Any virtual machine or container can see all broadcast and multicast packets received from or sent to the selected network adapter on the hardware node.
* Using bridged virtual adapters, you can host DHCP or Samba servers in virtual machines and containers.
--
* There is no more need to assign all network settings (IP addresses, subnet mask, gateway, and so on) to virtual machines and containers from the server. All network parameters can be set from inside virtual machines and containers.
* `veth` adapters can be bridged among themselves and with other devices. If several `veth` adapters are united into a bridge, this bridge can be used to handle network traffic for the virtual machines and containers whose `veth` adapters are included in the bridge.
* Due to the fact that `veth` adapters act as full members on the network (rather than "hidden" beyond virtual networks adapters on the server), they are more prone to security vulnerabilities: traffic sniffing, IP address collisions, and so on. Therefore, `veth` adapters are recommended for use in trusted network environments only.

Configuring Virtual Machines and Containers in Host-Routed Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the following parameters of network adapters that operate in the host-routed mode:

[options="compact"]
* IP addresses and network masks
* DNS servers
* DNS search domains

Setting IP Addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The session below shows how to set IP addresses for the virtual machine `MyVM` and the container `MyCT1`

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net0 --ipadd 10.0.186.100/24*
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net0 --ipadd 1fe80::20c:29ff:fe01:fb07*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ipadd 10.0.186.101/24*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ipadd fe80::20c:29ff:fe01:fb08*
----

`net0` in the commands above denotes the network card in the virtual machine `MyVM` to assign the IP address to. You can view all network cards of a virtual machine using the +prlctl list _VM_name_ -i+ command. For the container `MyCT1`, you do not need to specify the network card name; `prlctl set` automatically performs the operation on the default adapter that always operates in the host-routed mode.

Setting DNS Server Addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To set a DNS server for the virtual machine `MyVM` and the container `MyCT1`, you can use the following commands:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net0 --nameserver 192.168.1.165*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --nameserver 192.168.1.165*
----

Setting DNS Search Domains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To set a DNS search domain for the virtual machine `MyVM` and the container `MyCT1`, run these commands:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net0 --searchdomain 192.168.10.10*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --searchdomain 192.168.10.10*
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:*
[options="compact"]
. You can configure the network settings only of virtual machines that have Virtuozzo guest tools installed.
. Network adapters operating in the routed mode must have at least one static IP address assigned.
. To assign network masks to containers operating in the `venet0` networking mode, you must set the `USE_VENET_MASK` parameter in the `/etc/vz/vz.conf` configuration file to `yes`.
. Containers can have only one network adapter operating in the host-routed mode. This adapter is automatically created when you create a virtual machine.
====

Switching Virtual Machine Adapters to Host-Routed Mode
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, a virtual adapter in any newly created virtual machine starts operating in connected to the bridged mode (see <<_connecting_virtual_machines_to_virtual_networks>> for details). To change the current network mode to host-routed, you can run the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set &lt;VM_name&gt; --device-set Net_ID --type routed*
----

For example, to set the `net0` adapter in the virtual machine `MyVM` to operate in the host-routed mode, use this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net0 --type routed*
----

Configuring Virtual Machines and Containers in Bridged Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes all operations related to configuring virtual machines and containers that operate in bridged mode.

Managing Virtual Networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A virtual network acts as a binding interface between a virtual network adapter in a virtual machine or container and the corresponding network adapter on the hardware node. Using virtual networks, you can include virtual machines and containers in different networks. Virtuozzo enables you to manage virtual networks as follows:

[options="compact"]
* Create virtual networks.
* Configure virtual network parameters.
* List existing virtual networks.
* Delete virtual networks.

These operations are described in the following subsections in detail.

Creating Virtual Networks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, Virtuozzo creates the following virtual networks on the server:

[options="compact"]
* *Bridged* virtual network that is connected to one of the physical adapters on the hardware node (as a rule, `enp0s5`) and provides virtual machines and containers included in this virtual network with access to the network behind this physical adapter.
* *Host-only* virtual network that is connected to a special virtual adapter on the server and allows the virtual machines and containers joined to this virtual network to access only the server and the other virtual machines and containers on this network.

You can create your own virtual networks using the `prlsrvctl` command. For example, to create a new virtual network `network1`, you can run:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl net add network1*
----

By default, the command creates a host-only virtual network, but you can change its type if needed (see <<_configuring_virtual_network_parameters>>).

Configuring Virtual Network Parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Virtuozzo allows you to configure the following parameters for a virtual network:

[options="compact"]
* the name assigned to the virtual network
* the networking mode in which the virtual network is operating
* the description of the virtual network

All these operations can be performed using the `prlsrvctl` utility. Let us assume that you want to configure the `network1` virtual network. This virtual network is currently configured as a host-only network and has the following description: `This is a host-only virtual network`. To change these parameters, you can execute the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl net set network1 -n network2 -t bridged --ifname enp0s6 -d "This is now \*
*a bridged virtual network"*
----

This command configured the `network1` virtual network as follows:

[options="compact"]
. Changes the virtual network name to `network2`.
. Changes the virtual network type to bridged.
. Changes the virtual network description to the following: "This is now a bridged virtual network".

Listing Virtual Networks
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To list the virtual networks existing on the hardware node, you can use the `prlsrvctl` utility as shown below.

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl net list*
Network ID        Type      Bound To       Bridge
Host-Only         host-only                virbr1
Bridged           bridged   enp0s5         br0
----

This utility displays the following information on virtual networks:

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|====
|Column|Description

|Network ID|The name assigned to the virtual network.
|Type|The networking mode set for the virtual network.
|Bound To|The adapter on the hardware node connected to the virtual networks, if any.
|====

Connecting Virtual Networks to Adapters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By connecting an adapter on the physical server to a virtual network, you can join all virtual machines and containers included in the virtual network to the network to which the corresponding adapter is connected.

Let us assume the following:

[options="compact"]
* The `enp0s6` physical adapter and the `network1` virtual network exist on the hardware node. For information on creating virtual networks, see <<_creating_virtual_networks>>.
* The `enp0s6` physical adapter is connected to the local network.
* The container `MyCT1` is connected to the `network1` virtual network. Detailed information on joining virtual machines and containers to virtual networks is given in <<_connecting_containers_to_virtual_networks>> and <<_connecting_virtual_machines_to_virtual_networks>>.

To connect the `enp0s6` adapter to the `network1` virtual network and thus to join the container `MyCT1` to the network behind `enp0s6`, run this command on the server:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl net set network1 -i enp0s6*
----

To check that the `enp0s6` physical adapter has been successfully added to the `network1` virtual network, you can execute the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl net list*
Network ID        Type      Bound To       Bridge
Host-Only         host-only                virbr1
Bridged           bridged   enp0s5         br0
network1          bridged   enp0s6         br1
----

As you can see, the `enp0s6` adapter is now joined to the `network1` virtual network. That means that the container `MyCT1` whose virtual network adapter is connected to `network1` can access the local network behind `enp0s6`.

Deleting Virtual Networks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

At any time, you can remove a virtual network that you do not need any more from the physical server. To do this, you can use the `prlsrvctl` utility. For example, you can delete the `network1` virtual network by running the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl net del network1*
----

To check that `network1` has been successfully removed, execute this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl net list*
Network ID     Type        Bound To
Host-Only      host-only   
Bridged        bridged     enp0s5
----

Virtuozzo provides you with ample opportunities of configuring `veth` virtual network adapters in containers and including them in different network environments. This section shows you the way to perform the following operations:

[options="compact"]
* Create new virtual network adapters in containers and delete existing ones.
* Configure the parameters of an existing virtual network adapter.
* Join container virtual network adapters to virtual networks.

All these operations are described in the following subsections in detail.

Creating and Deleting veth Network Adapters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, any container on the hardware node starts functioning in the `venet0` mode right after its creation. However, at any time you can create additional virtual adapters for containers and set them to work in the bridged mode. You can do this using the `--netif_add` option of the `prlctl set` command.

Let us assume that you wish to create a new virtual adapter with the name of `netif1` in the container `MyCT1` and make it function in the bridged mode. To do this, run the following command :

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --netif_add netif1*
----

The settings of the newly created virtual adapter are saved as the value of the `NETIF` parameter in the configuration file of the container `MyCT1` (`/etc/vz/conf/26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc.conf`). So, you can use the following command to display the parameters assigned to the `veth` network adapter in the container `MyCT1`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# grep NETIF /etc/vz/conf/26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc.conf*
NETIF="ifname=netif1,mac=00:1C:42:63:B3:12,host_mac=FE:18:51:6C:0B:A8, \
network=Bridged,configure=none"
----

As you can see, the parameters set for the `veth` virtual network adapter during its creation are the following:

[options="compact"]
* `ifname`, name set for the `veth` Ethernet interface in the container `MyCT1`. You specified this name when creating the container virtual network adapter.
* `mac`, MAC address assigned to the `veth` Ethernet interface in the container `MyCT1`.
* `host_mac`, MAC address assigned to the `veth` Ethernet interface on the hardware node.

`ifname` is the only mandatory parameter that you need to specify when creating a container virtual network adapter. All the other parameters are optional and generated by Virtuozzo automatically, if not indicated.

At any time, you can remove the `veth` virtual network adapter from the container `MyCT1` by executing the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --netif_del netif1*
----

Configuring veth Adapter Parameters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

While functioning in the bridged mode, each container virtual network adapter appears as a full participant on the network to which it is connected and needs to have its own identity on this network.

Fist of all, to start functioning on a TCP/IP network, a `veth` virtual adapter should be assigned an IP address. This can be done as follows:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ifname netif1 --ipadd 192.168.144.123*
----

This command sets an IP address `192.168.144.123` for the `netif1` adapter in the container `MyCT1`. If you want to use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to make the `netif1` adapter of the container `MyCT1` automatically receive TCP/IP configuration settings, you can issue the following command instead:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ifname netif1 --dhcp yes*
----

Any static IP address assigned to the container virtual network adapter can be removed by executing the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ifname netif1 --ipdel 192.168.144.123*
----

You can also delete all IP addresses set for the container `MyCT1` at once:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ifname netif1 --ipdel all*
----

You may also wish to set the following parameters for a container network adapter:

* A DNS server that the container virtual adapter is supposed to use:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ifname netif1 --nameserver 192.168.100.111*
----
* A gateway to be used for routing the traffic of the container virtual adapter:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ifname netif1 --gw 192.168.111.1*
----

Connecting Containers to Virtual Networks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With the implementation of `veth` virtual adapters allowing containers to function as full participants on the network, it has become possible to include containers in a wide range of network configurations the most common of which are Ethernet networks. The process of connecting `veth` virtual network adapters to an Ethernet network is carried out using certain physical, respectively, available on the server and involves completing the following tasks:

[options="compact"]
. Creating a virtual network that will act as an intermediary between the `veth` adapters and the physical adapter.
. Connecting the `veth` virtual adapter you want to include in an Ethernet network to the virtual network.
. Joining the virtual network where the `veth` virtual adapters are included to the corresponding physical adapter.

After completing these tasks, the container virtual network adapters will be able to communicate with any computer on the network where they are included and have no direct access to the computers joined to other networks.

For details on creating new virtual networks and joining physical adapters to them, see <<_creating_virtual_networks>> and <<_connecting_virtual_networks_to_adapters>>, respectively. In the example below we assume the following:

[options="compact"]
* The `enp0s5` physical adapter and the `network1` virtual network exist on the server.
* The `enp0s5` physical adapter is connected to the local Ethernet network and to the `network1` virtual network.
* You want to connect the container `MyCT1` and the container `MyCT2` to the local Ethernet network.

To join the containers `MyCT1` and `MyCT2` to the local Ethernet network behind the `enp0s5` adapter, you need connect these containers to the `network1` virtual network. To do this:

. Find out the name of the `veth` Ethernet interfaces in the containers `MyCT1` and `MyCT2`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -a -o ctid,netif,netdev*
UUID                                     NETIF      NETDEV
{4e10b61a-c775-4611-a9b0-d4b946e820f2}   netif1     veth42ffa4e6
{eb0d3253-7e7a-486a-897f-02bfbd0e4c5b}   netif2     veth42a5246f
----
+
The command output shows that the `veth` Ethernet interfaces in the containers `MyCT1` and `MyCT2` have the names of `netif1` and `netif2`, respectively.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* To add a `veth` adapter to a virtual network, you must use the name of its Ethernet interface in the container. 
====
. Join the `veth` adapters to the `network1` virtual network:
** Add the `veth` adapters of both containers to the virtual network:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ifname netif1 --network network1*
*# prlctl set MyCT2 --ifname netif2 --network network1*
----

After completing these tasks, the containers `MyCT1` and `MyCT2` will be able to access any of the servers in the network where the `enp0s5` physical adapter is connected.

At any time, you can disconnect the `veth` virtual network adapters of the containers `MyCT1` and `MyCT2` from the `network1` virtual network by executing the following commands:

* To disconnect the `veth` adapters of containers `MyCT1` and `MyCT2` from the virtual network:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --ifname netif1 --network ""*
*# prlctl set MyCT2 --ifname netif2 --network ""*
----

Managing Adapters in Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section provides information on how you can manage virtual network adapters in virtual machines. You will learn to do the following:

[options="compact"]
* Create new virtual network adapters and delete existing ones.
* Configure the parameters of an existing virtual network adapter.
* Join virtual network adapters to virtual networks.

All these operations are described in the following subsections in detail.

Creating and Deleting Virtual Adapters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A virtual machine can have up to 16 virtual network adapters. Each adapter can be connected to a different network. Let us assume that you want to create a new virtual adapter for the virtual machine `MyVM`. To do this, you can execute the following command :

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-add net*
Creating net1 (+) type=host-only iface=&apos;default&apos; mac=001C42AF3D69
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

To check that the network adapter (`net1`) has been successfully added to the virtual machine, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list --info MyVM*
ID: {f3b3d134-f512-324b-b0b1-dbd642f5220b}
Name: Windows XP
...
net0 (+) type=host-only iface=&apos;default&apos; mac=001C42566BCF
net1 (+) type=host-only iface=&apos;default&apos; mac=001C42AF3D69
----

At any time, you can remove the newly created network adapter (`net1`) by executing the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-del net1*
Remove the net1 device.
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

Configuring Virtual Adapter Parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Virtuozzo allows you to configure the following parameters of virtual machine adapters:

*Configuring MAC Addresses*

If you need for some reason to regenerate the current MAC address of a network adapter, you can use the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net1 --mac 00:1C:42:2D:74:00*
Creating net1 (+) network=Bridged mac=001C422D7400
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

This command sets the MAC address of `00:1C:42:2D:74:00` for the `net1` adapter in the virtual machine `MyVM`. If do not know what MAC address to assign to your virtual adapter, you can make `prlctl set` automatically generate a new MAC address. To do this, run the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net1 --mac auto*
Creating net1 (+) network=Bridged mac=001C42C84F3E
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

*Configuring IP Parameters*

As any other standalone server, each virtual machine must have a number of TCP/IP settings configured in the proper way to successfully operate on the network. These settings include:

[options="compact"]
* IP address
* default gateway
* DNS server

Usually, you define all these settings when you create the virtual machine. However, if you have not yet set any of the settings or want to modify any of them, you can use the `prlctl set` command. For example, you can execute the following command to assign the IP address of `192.129.129.20` to the `net1` adapter in the virtual machine `MyVM`, set the default gateway to `192.129.129.1` and the DNS server to `192.192.192.10`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net1 --ipadd 192.129.129.20 --gw 192.129.129.1 \
--nameserver 192.192.192.10*
----

Along with a static assignment of network parameters to a virtual adapter, you can make the adapter receive its TCP/IP settings automatically using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). For example, you can run this command to make the `net1` adapter in the virtual machine `MyVM` get its IP settings through DHCP:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net1 --dhcp yes*
Creating net1 (+) network=Bridged mac=001C42C84F3E
Enable automatic reconfiguration for this network adapter.
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* You can configure the network parameters only of those virtual machines that have Virtuozzo guest tools installed.
====

Connecting Virtual Machines to Virtual Networks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In Virtuozzo, you can connect virtual machines to virtual networks of the following types:

[options="compact"]
* *Bridged* virtual network allows the virtual machine to use one of the physical server's network adapters, which makes it appear as a separate computer on the network the corresponding adapter belongs to.
* *Host-only* virtual network allows the virtual machine to access only the hardware node and the virtual machines joined to this network.

By default, any newly created adapter is connected to the Bridged network. To join a virtual machine to another network, use the `prlctl set` command. For example, the following session demonstrates how you can connect the `net0` adapter of the virtual machine `MyVM` to the `network1` virtual network.

Before connecting the virtual machine `MyVM` to the `network1` virtual network, you may wish to check the network adapter associated with this virtual network. You can do it, for example, using the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
# prlsrvctl net list
Network ID        Type      Bound To
Host-Only         host-only         
Bridged           bridged   enp0s5
network1          bridged   enp0s6   
----

From the command output, you can see that the `network1` virtual network is attached to the `enp0s6` physical adapter on the hardware node. That means that, after connecting the virtual machine `MyVM` to the `network1` virtual network, the virtual machine will be able to access all computers on the network where the `enp0s6` adapter is connected.

Now you can run the following command to join the `net1` adapter of the virtual machine `MyVM` to the `network1` virtual network:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net0 --network network1*
Creating net0 (+) network=network1 mac=001C422D7493
The VM has been successfully configured.
----

Keeping Your System Up To Date
------------------------------

This chapter explains the ways to keep your hardware node up to date. The components you need to take care of are the following:

[options="compact"]
* Virtuozzo software
* virtual machines and containers hosted on the server

Updating Virtuozzo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo allows quick and easy updates with the `yum` utility standard for RPM-compatible Linux operating systems. The main components you may need to update are the following:

[options="compact"]
* utilities and libraries,
* kernel,
* EZ templates.

Updating All Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to update all components of the Virtuozzo software is to simply run the `yum update` command. When executed, this command tells the `yum` utility to do the following:

[options="compact"]
. Access remote Virtuozzo repositories.
. Check for available updates for the Virtuozzo kernel, utilities, libraries, and EZ templates.
. Install the found updates on your system.

Note that the `yum` utility can only update the packages that are already installed on the server. So if a package is not available on your system, you first need to install the package using the `yum install` command.

Updating Kernel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updating the Virtuozzo kernel requires updating the `vzkernel` and `vzkernel-devel` packages:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# yum update vzkernel vzkernel-devel*
----

Updating EZ Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can update an EZ template like any other RPM package using the `yum update` command. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# yum update centos-6-x86_64-ez*
...
Updated:
  centos-6-x86_64-ez.noarch 0:4.7.0-1                                                                                                                                      
Complete!
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:*
[options="compact"]
. Updating an OS EZ template requires that you append `ez` to template name.
. You can also use the `vzpkg update template` command to update EZ templates.
====

Checking for Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before updating any packages, you may want to see which can be updated and to what version. You can do that with the `yum check-update` command. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# yum check-update*
----

Performing More Actions with yum
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `yum` command allows you to do more than just check for and install updates. Some of the other useful options that may help you in updating Virtuozzo are `search`, `list`, `info`, `deplist`, `provide`. For more information on these and other options, see the `yum` manual page.

Updating Software in Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To keep software in your virtual machines up to date, you can use the same means you would use on standalone computers running the corresponding operating systems:

[options="compact"]
* In Linux-based virtual machines, you can use the native Linux updaters (`up2date`, `yum`, or `yast`).
* In Windows-based virtual machines, you can use the native Windows updaters (e.g., the Windows Update tool).

Updating Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo provides two means of keeping your containers up to date:

[options="compact"]
* Updating EZ templates software packages inside a particular container by means of the `vzpkg` utility. Using this facility, you can keep any of the containers existing on your hardware node up to date.
* Updating caches of the OS EZ templates installed on the hardware node. This facility allows you to create new containers already having the latest software packages installed.

Updating EZ Template Packages in Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtuozzo allows you to update packages of the OS EZ template a container is based on and of any application EZ templates applied to the container. You can do it by using the `vzpkg update` utility. Assuming that the container `MyCT1` is based on the `centos-6-x86_64` OS EZ template, you can issue the following command to update all packages included in this template:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzpkg update 26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc centos-6-x86_64*
...
  Updating: httpd                ####################### [1/4]
  Updating: vzdev                ####################### [2/4]
  Cleanup : vzdev                ####################### [3/4]
  Cleanup : httpd                ####################### [4/4]
Updated: httpd.i386 0:2.0.54-10.2 vzdev.noarch 0:1.0-4.swsoft
Complete!
Updated:
 httpd                  i386      0:2.0.54-10.2
 vzdev                  noarch    0:1.0-4.swsoft
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:*
[options="compact"]
. Updating EZ templates is supported for running containers only.
. If  you are going to update the cache of a commercial OS EZ template (e.g., Red Hat Enterprise Server 5 or SLES 10), you should first update software packages in the remote repository used to handle this OS EZ template and then proceed with updating the EZ template cache.
====

As you can see from the example above, the `httpd` and `vzdev` applications have been updated for the `centos-6-x86_64` OS EZ template. If you wish to update all EZ templates (including the OS EZ template) inside the container `MyCT1` at once, execute this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzpkg update 26bc47f6-353f-444b-bc35-b634a88dbbcc*
...
Running Transaction
  Updating  : hwdata               ###################### [1/2]
  Cleanup   : hwdata               ###################### [2/2]
Updated: hwdata.noarch 0:1.0-3.swsoft
Complete!
Updated:
 hwdata                 noarch    0:0.158.1-1
----

In the example above, only the `hwdata` package inside the container `MyCT1` was out of date and updated to the latest version.

Updating OS EZ Template Caches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the release of new updates for the corresponding Linux distribution, the created OS EZ template cache can become obsolete. Virtuozzo allows you to quickly update your OS EZ template caches using the `vzpkg update cache` command.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* If  you are going to update the cache of a commercial OS EZ template (e.g., Red Hat Enterprise Server 6 or SLES 11), you should first update software packages in the remote repository used to handle this OS EZ template and then proceed with updating the EZ template cache.
====

When executed, `vzpkg update cache` checks the `cache` directory in the template area (`/vz/template/cache` by default) on the hardware node and updates all existing tarballs in this directory. However, you can explicitly indicate the tarball for what OS EZ template should be updated by specifying the OS EZ template name. For example, to update the tarball for the `centos-6-x86_64` OS EZ template, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzpkg update cache centos-6-x86_64*
Loading "rpm2vzrpm" plugin
Setting up Update Process
Setting up repositories
base0            100% |=========================|  951 B    00:00
base1            100% |=========================|  951 B    00:00
base2            100% |=========================|  951 B    00:00
base3            100% |=========================|  951 B    00:00
...
----

Upon the `vzpkg update cache` execution, the old tarball name gets the `-old` suffix (e.g., `centos-x86.tar.gz-old`):

You can also pass the `-f` option to `vzpkg update cache` to remove an existing tar archive and create a new one instead of it.

If the `vzpkg update cache` command does not find a tarball for one or several OS EZ templates installed on the server, it creates tar archives of the corresponding OS EZ templates and puts them to the `/vz/template/cache` directory.

Advanced Tasks
--------------

This chapter describes those tasks that are intended for advanced system administrators who would like to obtain deeper knowledge about Virtuozzo capabilities.

Configuring Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Capabilities are sets of bits that permit of splitting the privileges typically held by the root user into a larger set of more specific privileges. The POSIX capabilities are defined by a draft IEEE standard (IEEE Std 1003.1e); they are not unique to Linux or Virtuozzo. When the Linux or Virtuozzo documentation says "requires root privileges", in nearly all cases it really means "requires a specific capability".

This section documents the tasks that can be achieved using per-container capabilities in Virtuozzo and all configurable capabilities.

Available Capabilities for Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section lists all the capabilities that can be set with the `vzctl set` command. The capabilities are divided into two tables: the capabilities defined by the POSIX draft standard and Linux-specific capabilities. For each capability, its description is given together with the default value for a container.

Please note that it is easy to create a non-working container or compromise your hardware node security by setting capabilities incorrectly. Do not change any capability for a container without a full understanding of what this capability can lead to.

Capabilities Defined by POSIX Draft
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[options="header",cols="2,5,1"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default

|`chown`|If a process has this capability set on, it can change ownership on the files not belonging to it or belonging to another user. You have to set this capability on to allow the container root user to change ownership on files and directories inside the container.|on
|`dac_override`|This capability allows to access files even if the permission is set to disable access. Normally leave this on to let the container root access files even if the permission does not allow it.|on
|`dac_read_search`|Overrides restrictions on reading and searching for files and directories. The explanation is almost the same as above with the sole exclusion that this capability does not override executable restrictions.|on
|`fowner`|Overrides restrictions on setting the `S_ISUID` and `S_ISGID` bits on a file requiring that the effective user ID and effective group ID of the process shall match the file owner ID. |on
|`fsetid`|Used to decide between falling back on the old `suser()` or `fsuser()`.|on
|`kill`|Allows sending signals to processes owned by other users.|on
|`setgid`|Allows group ID manipulation and forged group IDs on socket credentials passing.|on
|`setuid`|Allows user ID manipulation and forged user IDs on socket credentials passing.|on
|====

Linux-specific Capabilities
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[options="header",cols="2,5,1"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default
|`setpcap`|Transfer any capability in your permitted set to any process ID; remove any capability in your permitted set from any process ID.|off
|`linux_immutable`|Allows the modification of the `S_IMMUTABLE` and `S_APPEND` file attributes. These attributes are implemented only for the EXT2FS and EXT3FS Linux file systems. However, if you bind mount a directory located on the EXT2FS or EXT3FS file system into a container and revoke this capability, the root user inside the container will not be able to delete or truncate files with these attributes on.|on
|`net_bind_service`|Allows to bind to sockets with numbers below 1024.|on
|`net_broadcast`|Allows network broadcasting and multicast access.|on
|`net_admin`|Allows the administration of IP firewalls and accounting.|off

|`ipc_lock`|Allows to lock shared memory segments and `mlock/mlockall` calls.|on
|`ipc_owner`|Overrides IPC ownership checks.|on
|`sys_module`|Insert and remove kernel modules. Be very careful with setting this capability on for a container; if a user has the permission of inserting kernel modules, this user has essentially full control over the hardware node.|off
|`sys_chroot`|Allows to use `chroot()`.|on
|`sys_ptrace`|Allows to trace any process.|on
|`sys_pacct`|Allows to configure process accounting.|on

|`lease`|Allows to take leases of files.|on
|====

Creating Customized Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to use custom applications in multiple identical containers, you can create containers with necessary applications already preinstalled and tuned to meet your demands.

Virtuozzo offers several ways to create customized containers with preinstalled applications:

[options="compact"]
* From a golden image (an OS EZ template cache with preinstalled application templates).
* From a custom OS EZ template that specifies a custom application package list.
* From a custom configuration sample file that specifies custom application EZ templates.

Using Golden Image Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The golden image functionality allows you to preinstall application templates to OS EZ template caches to speed up creating multiple containers based on the same set of OS and application templates. Previously, you could either install application templates to each container after creating it or embed them directly into a custom OS template. Golden image is currently the easiest and fastest way to create containers with preinstalled applications.

The best way to create such a cache is:

. Make a custom sample configuration file with information on the OS EZ template to cache and application EZ templates to preinstall. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# cp /etc/vz/conf/ve-basic.conf-sample \*
*/etc/vz/conf/ve-centos-6-x86_64-mysql-devel.conf-sample*
----
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* If you already have a custom sample configuration file with application EZ templates specified in it, you can reuse it instead of creating a new one.
====
. Add the OS EZ template and application EZ template information to the new configuration file. Each OS and application template name must be preceded by a dot. Multiple consecutive application EZ template names must be separated by white spaces. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]

Disabling Golden Image Functionality
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Golden Image functionality allows you to preinstall application templates to OS EZ template caches to speed up creating multiple containers based on the same set of OS and application templates. Previously, you could either install application templates to each container after creating it or embed them directly into a custom OS template. Golden Image is currently the easiest and fastest way to create containers with preinstalled applications.

The Golden Image functionality is enabled by default in the `/etc/sysconfig/vz/vz.conf` global configuration file. Should you wish to disable it, do one of the following:

[options="compact"]
* Set the `GOLDEN_IMAGE` option to `no` in the Virtuozzo global configuration file. The Golden Image functionality will be disabled globally.
* Set the `GOLDEN_IMAGE` option to `no` in the container sample configuration file. The Golden Image functionality will be disabled for commands that use this specific sample configuration file.
* Create a file named `golden_image` containing `no` in the OS EZ template's configuration directory. The Golden Image functionality will be disabled for this specific OS EZ template.
* Create a file named `golden_image` containing `no` in the application template's configuration directory. The Golden Image functionality will be disabled for this specific application template, so it will not be preinstalled into any OS EZ template caches.

Using Customized EZ Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create custom OS and application templates tailored to your needs. In such a template, you only need to specify parameters that differ from those in the default template. All other parameters--that are not explicitly set in the custom template--are inherited from the corresponding default template.

To create a custom template, do the following:

. If required, install the default OS template on the hardware node. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*yum install centos-7-x86_64-ez*
----

. Create a directory for your template at the location where the default template directory is. For example, for a custom CentOS 7 64-bit template `mytmpl`, create the directory `/vz/template/centos/7/x86_64/config/os/mytmpl`.
. If you are creating a custom OS template, specify repositories. For example, copy the file `mirrorlist` from the default template directory to your template directory:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# cp /vz/template/centos/7/x86_64/config/os/default/mirrorlist \*
*/vz/template/centos/7/x86_64/config/os/mytmpl*
----

. In your template directory, create the file `packages` listing the packages you need, one per line. For example, just `yum`.
. Optionally, change more template parameters according to your needs (for a description of parameters, see the next section).

Your custom template is ready. In this example, it is an OS template that contains just `yum` and all its prerequisites. You now can create containers based on it. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzctl create MyCT1 --vmtype ct --ostemplate centos-7-x86_64-mytmpl*
----

If you created an application template, you now can add it to the container configuration file as described in <<_using_golden_image_functionality>>.

EZ Template Configuration Files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

All EZ templates are stored in `/vz/template`, in subdirectories named according to OS name, version, and architecture. For example, `/vz/template/centos/7/x86_64`. Each template includes a set of configuration files stored in the +/config/os/_<template_name>_+ subdirectory (OS templates) or the +/config/app/_<template_name>_+ subdirectory (application templates).

The following files can be in the template configuration subdirectory:

[options="compact"]
* `ct2vm` -- Container to virtual machine migration script (not used in this technical preview of Virtuozzo 7).
* `description` -- Detailed information on the EZ template.
* `distribution` -- OS templates only. The name of the Linux distribution for which the EZ template is created.
* `environment` -- OS templates only. A list of environment variables set in the form of +_<key>_=_<value>_+.
* `mirrorlist` -- Links to files with lists of repositories from which the packages in the EZ template are to be downloaded.
* `osrelease` -- OS templates only. Contains native CentOS 7 distribution kernel version.
* `package_manager` -- OS templates only. Specifies the packaging system used to handle the EZ template.
* `packages` -- Contains a list of package names included in the corresponding EZ template.
* `pre-cache`, `post-cache` -- OS templates only. Scripts that are executed before and after the packages in the EZ template are installed on the hardware node.
* `pre-install`, `post-install` -- Scripts that are executed inside the container before and after the package management transaction.
* `pre-install-hn`, `post-install-hn` -- Scripts that are executed on the hardware node before and after the package management transaction.
* `pre-upgrade`, `post-upgrade` -- OS templates only. Scripts that are executed before and after updating packages inside the container.
* `pre-remove`, `post-remove` -- Scripts that are executed before and after removing the application EZ template or package from the container.
* `release` -- Contains template release number.
* `repositories` -- Contains a list of repositories where the packages in the EZ template are stored.
* `summary` -- A brief summary of the EZ template.
* `upgradable_versions` -- OS templates only.
* `version` -- Contains template version number.

Creating Customized EZ Template RPMs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To share a custom EZ template between hardware nodes, you can create an RPM package with it as follows:

[options="compact"]
. Download the default OS template source from http://download.openvz.org/virtuozzo/releases/7.0/source/SRPMS.
. Edit the template according to your needs, e.g., change OS template parameters, add, change or remove application templates, and such.
. Build the RPM from the `.spec` file in a clean environment using standard tools. Do not build more than one template at once.

Creating and Configuring Docker-enabled Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a Virtuozzo container ready for running Docker containers, do the following:

. Create a container with a guest OS for which a Docker application template is available. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzctl create MyCT1 --ostemplate centos-6-x86_64*
----
+
In the current version of Virtuozzo, Docker application templates are available for CentOS 7 and Fedora 21 operating systems.

. Configure network access in the container. For details, see <<_configuring_network_settings>>.
. Enable bridges in the container. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --features bridge:on*
----
. Allow all `iptables` modules for the container. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --netfilter full*
----
. Start the container. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl start MyCT1*
----
. Install the Docker application template into the container. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzpkg install MyCT1 docker*
----

To check that Docker is configured correctly, you can create a test Docker container inside the configured Virtuozzo container. For example:

. Increase container RAM and diskspace for running multiple Docker containers. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --memsize 4G*
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --diskspace 25G*
----
. Launch MySQL:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# docker run --name test-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123qwe -d mysql*
----
. Launch WordPress:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# docker run --name test-wordpress --link test-mysql:mysql -p 8080:80 -d wordpress*
----
. Log in to your WordPress installation by visiting the IP address of the Virtuozzo container at port 8080.

[NOTE]

Restrictions and Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[options="compact"]
* Checkpointing and live migration of Virtuozzo containers with Docker containers inside is not supported.
* Only the `vfs` Docker graph driver is currently supported.
* Bridges cannot be created inside Docker containers running inside a Virtuozzo container. (You can create bridges inside Virtuozzo containers as usual.)

Restarting Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can restart containers from the inside using typical Linux commands, e.g., `reboot` or `shutdown -r`. Restarting is handled by the `vzeventd` daemon.

If necessary, you can forbid restarting containers from the inside as follows:

[options="compact"]
* To disable restarting for a specific container, add the `ALLOWREBOOT="no"` line to the container configuration file (+/etc/vz/conf/_&lt;UUID&gt;_.conf+).
* To disable restarting globally for all containers on the server, add the `ALLOWREBOOT="no"` line to the global configuration file (`/etc/vz/vz.conf`).
* To disable restarting globally except for specific containers, add the `ALLOWREBOOT="no"` line to the global configuration file (`/etc/vz/vz.conf`) and explicitly specify `ALLOWREBOOT="yes"` in the configuration files of the respective containers.

Enabling VNC Access to Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use your favorite VNC clients to connect to and manage containers and virtual machines. To do this, you need to complete these steps:

[options="compact"]
. Enable VNC access in the desired virtual machine or container.
. Connect to the virtual machine or container with a VNC client.

The sections below describe both steps in details.

Enabling VNC Access to Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable VNC access to a virtual machine, you need to do the following:

. Enable VNC support in the virtual machine.
. Specify the TCP port number on the physical server that will be used to listen to VNC connections for the virtual machine.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* A unique port number must be specified for each virtual machine where you plan to connect via VNC.
====

. Set a password to secure your VNC connection.

You can perform all these operations with a single command. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --vnc-mode manual --vnc-port 5901 --vnc-passwd XXXXXXXX*
----

The changes will come into effect on the next virtual machine start.

Enabling VNC Access to Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable VNC access to a container, you need to do the following:

[options="compact"]
. Make sure you have a valid user account in the container to be able to log into it.
. Make sure the container is running.
. Set the VNC mode and password for the container. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --vnc-mode manual --vnc-port 6501 --vnc-passwd XXXXXXXX*
----
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Port number must be unique for each container you open VNC access to. In the auto mode, correct port numbers are assigned automatically. In the manual mode, you need to make sure port numbers are unique yourself.
====

Connecting with a VNC Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After you have enabled VNC access to the virtual machine or container, you can connect to it with your favorite VNC client. To do this, you need to pass the following parameters to the VNC client:

[options="compact"]
* IP address of the server where the virtual machine or container is hosted.
* Port number and password you specified when enabling VNC access.
* Valid user account in the virtual machine or container.

Managing iptables Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to manage `iptables` modules for both physical servers and containers.

Using iptables Modules in Virtuozzo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Filtering network packets on hardware nodes running Virtuozzo does not differ from doing so on a typical Linux server. You can use the standard `iptables` tool to control how network packets enter, move through, and exit the network stack within the Virtuozzo kernel.

When you enable connection tracking for virtual machines and containers (e.g., for NAT), consider disabling it for the hardware node itself. This way the node will still be reachable in case of a DoS attack. To disable connection tracking for the hardware node itself:

[options="compact"]
. specify `options nf_conntrack ip_conntrack_disable_ve0=1` in the file `/etc/modprobe.d/parallels.conf`,
. reload the `nf_conntrack` module or restart the hardware node.

For your reference, below are several resources you can consult to get detailed information on using `iptables` on Linux servers:

[options="compact"]
* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Security_Guide/index.html[_Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Security Guide_] contains a section focusing on packet filtering basics and explaining various options available for `iptables`.
* http://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html[_iptables Tutorial 1.2.2_] explains in great detail how `iptables` is structured and works.

Using iptables Modules in Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using `iptables` modules in containers requires additional configuration on your part.

Configuring iptables Modules
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To set the state of `iptables` modules for backup/restore or live migration, use the `prlctl set --netfilter` command. If some of the `iptables` modules allowed for a container are not loaded on the hardware node where that container has been restored or migrated, they will be automatically loaded when that container starts. For example, the command

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --netfilter stateful*
----

will make sure that all modules except NAT-related will be allowed and loaded for the container `MyCT1` (if required) on a hardware node where it has been restored or migrated.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:*
[options="compact"]
. The default setting is `stateless`, which allows all modules except `conntrack` and NAT-related.
. To run Docker inside a Virtuozzo container, allow all `iptables` modules for that container with the `prlctl set --netfilter full` command. For details on configuring Docker in Virtuozzo, see <<_creating_and_configuring_docker_enabled_containers>>.
====

Using conntrack Rules and NAT Tables
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, the NAT table and `conntrack` rules are disabled and not allowed for use in containers even if they are loaded on the server. To allow their use in containers, run the `prlctl set --netfilter full` command. For example, for the container `MyCT1`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --netfilter full*
----

To limit the maximum number of conntrack slots available for each container on the hardware node, set the `net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max` variable. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# sysctl -w net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max=50000*
----

The value of `net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max` cannot exceed the value of `net.nf_conntrack_max`.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Even if a container is under a DoS attack and all its conntrack slots are in use, other containers will not be affected, still being able to create as many connections as set in `net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max`.
====

Creating Configuration Files for New Linux Distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Distribution configuration files are used to distinguish among containers running different Linux versions and to determine what scripts should be executed when performing the relevant container-related operations (e.g., assigning a new IP address to the container).

All Linux distributions shipped with Virtuozzo have their own configuration files located in the `/etc/vz/conf/dists` directory on the hardware node. However, you may wish to create your own distribution configuration files to support new Linux versions released. Let us assume that you wish your containers to run the CentOS 7 Linux distribution and, therefore, have to make the `centos-7.conf` distribution configuration file to define what scripts are to be executed while performing major tasks with containers running this Linux version. To do this:

. In the container configuration file (with the name of +/etc/vz/conf/_&lt;UUID&gt;_.conf+), specify `centos-7` as the value of the `DISTRIBUTION` variable (for example, `DISTRIBUTION="centos-7"`).
. Create the `centos-7.conf` configuration file in the `/etc/vz/conf/dists` directory. The easiest way to do it is copy one of the existing configuration files by executing the following command in the `/etc/vz/conf/dists` directory:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# cp fedora.conf centos-7.config*
----
+
In the example above, we assume that the `fedora.conf` file is present in the `/etc/vz/conf/dists` directory on the hardware node. In case it is not, you may use any other distribution configuration file available on your server.

. Open the `centos.conf` file for editing, go to the first entry and, in the right part of the entry, specify the name of the script you wish to be run on issuing the `prlctl` command with the parameter specified in the left part of the entry. For example, if you wish the script to be executed while assigning a new IP address to your container and the script has the `my_centos_script` name, your entry should look as follows:
+
----
ADD_IP=my_centos_script-add_ip.sh
----
. Repeat *Step 3* for all entries in the file.
. Place the scripts for the new Linux distribution to the `/etc/vz/conf/dists/scripts` directory on the Node. Make sure the names of these scripts coincide with those specified in the `centos-7.conf` file.

Aligning Disks and Partitions in Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the modern operating systems (Windows Server 2008 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6) automatically align the partitions when you install them in virtual machines. For example, Windows Server 2008 creates a default partition offset of 1024 KB to satisfy the partition alignment requirements. The following figure shows an example of the correct partition alignment:

image::images/correctpartitionalignment.png[align="center"]

In this example, any cluster (the smallest unit of data) in the guest OS file system is aligned with the boundaries of an NFS block, and reading from or writing to a cluster requires only access to one NFS block. For example, reading from Cluster 1 causes only a read from Block 1.

At the same time, virtual machines running non-modern systems (for example, Windows Server 2003 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5) do usually have misaligned partitions, which is shown in the figure below:

image::images/incorrectpartitionalignment.png[align="center"]

In this example, clusters of the guest OS file system do not match the boundaries of NFS blocks, and reading from or writing to a cluster requires access to several NFS blocks. For example, reading from Cluster 1 causes two reads: from Block 1 and from Block 2. This results in a slower read time as compared to properly aligned partitions and leads to performance degradation.

Aligning Partitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basically, to align disks and partitions in virtual machines, you need to set an offset so that clusters in the guest OS file system match the volume block size on your NFS storage. Usually, the block size of most network storages is 512 bytes or a multiple of 512 bytes. As an example, the following sections describe the procedure of aligning disks and partitions for Linux and Windows virtual machines assuming that the size of your NFS blocks is 512 bytes.

When deciding on aligning disks and partitions, take into account that this process destroys all data on these disks and partitions. So if you want to have a correctly aligned system partition, you need to align your disks and partitions before creating a virtual machine and installing a guest operating system in it. If you do not want an aligned system partition, you can first create a virtual machine and install a guest OS in it, and then align your data disks from inside the virtual machine.

The sections below demonstrate how to align disks and partitions before you start installing a guest OS. You can, however, use a similar procedure to align data disks and partitions from inside your virtual machines.

Checking Partition Alignment in Existing Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First of all, you may wish to know how you can check that the partitions of a virtual machine are not aligned. Depending on the operating system installed in the virtual machine, you can do the following.

Linux Virtual Machines
++++++++++++++++++++++

To check the partition alignment in a Linux virtual machine, log in to this virtual machine and run the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# fdisk -l -u /dev/device_name*
----

For example, to check the partition alignment on the sdc device, you can run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# fdisk -l -u /dev/sdc*
Disk /dev/sdc: 73.0 GB, 73014444032 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 8876 cylinders, total 142606336 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
   Device	Boot	Start	      End	Blocks	Id	System
/dev/sdc1	*	   63	   208844	104391	83	Linux
/dev/sdc2	       208845	142592939    71192047+	8e	Linux LVM
----

Pay attention to the number of sectors in the *Start* column. Usually, a sector contains 512 bytes, which makes up 32256 bytes for 63 sectors for the `/dev/sdc1` partition and 26105625 bytes for 208845 for the `/dev/sdc2` partition. For a partition to be properly aligned, it must align with 4096 byte boundaries (assuming that the block size of your storage is 4 KB). As 32256 and 106928640 is not a multiple of 4096, the partitions `/dev/sdc1` and `/dev/sdc2` are not aligned properly. To align them, you should offset

[options="compact"]
* the `/dev/sdc1` partition by 1 sector so that it starts at 64. In this case, 64 sectors each containing 512 bytes make up 32768 that is a multiple of 4096.
* the `/dev/sdc2` partition by 3 sectors so that it starts at 208848. In this case, 208848 sectors each containing 512 bytes make up 106930176 that is a multiple of 4096.

Windows Virtual Machines
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To check the partition alignment in a Windows virtual machine, do the following:

[options="compact"]
. Click *Start* > *Run*, type `msinfo32.exe`, and press *Enter* to open *System Information*.
. Navigate to *Components* > *Storage* > *Disks*, and look for the *Partition Starting Offset* field in the right part of the window.
+
image::images/checkingoffset.png[align="center"]

To find out if the partition is aligned properly, use the method described above for Linux virtual machines.

Aligning Disks for Linux Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To align partitions for use in a Linux virtual machine, you need a working Linux virtual machine. Once you have it at hand, follow the steps below:

[options="compact"]
. Create a new disk for the virtual machine.
+
On this disk, you will create aligned partitions. Then you will connect the disk to a new virtual machine and install your Linux guest OS on this disk.
. Start the virtual machine and log in to it using SSH.
. Run the `fdisk` utility for the disk you want to align.
. Create a primary partition, and set the starting block number for the created partition.
. Repeat steps 3-4 to create and align all partitions you plan to have in your new virtual machine.

The following example creates partition #1 with the size of 1 GB on the `/dev/sda` device and uses the offset of 64 KB.

[subs="quotes"]

and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
	(e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

----

Once you align all the necessary partitions, disconnect the disk from the virtual machine. When creating a new virtual machine, choose this disk for use with this virtual machine.

Aligning Partitions for Windows Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To align a disk for a Windows virtual machine, you need a working Windows virtual machine. Once you have it at hand, you can use the `diskpart` or `diskpar` utility (depending on your operating system) to align the disk:

. Create a new disk for the virtual machine.
+
On this disk, you will create aligned partitions. Then you will connect the disk to a new virtual machine and install your Windows guest OS on this disk.
. Open the command-line prompt, and run the `diskpart` or `diskpar` utility.
. Select the disk you want to align.
. Create the primary partition on the disk, and align it.
. Exit the `diskpart` or `diskpar` utility, and close the command-line prompt.

The following example demonstrates how to use the `diskpart` utility to align disk 1 by setting the offset of 64 for it:

image::images/usingdiskpart.png[align="center"]

Once you align the virtual disk, disconnect it from the virtual machine. When creating a new virtual machine, choose this disk for use with this virtual machine.

Creating a Template of a Virtual Machine with Aligned Partitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To facilitate the procedure of creating virtual machines that have aligned system partitions, you can create a template of the aligned virtual machine and deploy new virtual machines from this template.

For example, if you align a disk by following the steps in <<_aligning_partitions_for_windows_virtual_machines>>, then create a new virtual machine that uses this disk, and then install Windows Server 2003 operating system in the virtual machine, you will have a clean Windows Server 2003 installation on the correctly aligned disk. Now you can create a template of this virtual machine and use this template each time you need to deploy a new virtual machine with Windows Server 2003.

Memory Optimization for Virtual Machines Using KSM 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To optimize memory usage by virtual machines Virtuozzo uses a new Linux feature--KSM (Kernel Same-Page Merging). The KSM daemon `ksmd` periodically scans memory for pages with identical content and merges those into a single page. Said page is marked as copy-on-write (COW), so when its contents are changed by a virtual machine, the kernel creates a new copy for that virtual machine. 

KSM enables the host to:

[options="compact"]
* avoid swapping due to merging of identical pages;
* run more virtual machines;
* overcommit virtual machine memory;
* speed up RAM and hence certain applications and guest operating systems.

KSM can be managed by means of two services:

[options="compact"]
* The `ksm` service that starts and stops the KSM kernel thread.
* The `ksmtuned` service that controls and tunes the `ksm` using the parameters set in the `/etc/ksmtuned.conf` file.

You can start the `ksm` and `ksmtuned` services by executing the following commands:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*service ksm start*
*service ksmtuned start*
----

To check that the feature works, you can check the number of currently shared memory pages in `/sys/kernel/mm/ksm/pages_sharing` with virtual machines running. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# cat /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/pages_sharing*
3159
----

To stop the services, run:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*service ksm stop*
*service ksmtuned stop*
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:* 
[options="compact"]
. It is not advisable to use the KSM daemon if CPU resourses may become a bottleneck.
. It is recommended to avoid cross-node memory merging when KSM is in use as this may result in a significant performance drop after a lot of pages are shared. To disable merging pages across NUMA nodes, replace the contents of `/sys/kernel/mm/ksm/merge_across_nodes` with `0`.
. Using KSM may affect virtual machine security. For more details, see http://kb.odin.com/en/126594.

Installing Optional Virtuozzo Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo comes with everything you may need already installed. However, you can also install optional Virtuozzo packages from remote repositories by means of the `yum` command.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* For more information on using `yum` in Virtuozzo, see <<_updating_virtuozzo>> and the `yum` manual page.

Troubleshooting
---------------

This chapter provides the information about those problems that may occur during your work with Virtuozzo and suggests the ways to solve them.

General Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The general issues to take into consideration when troubleshooting your system are listed below. You should read them carefully before trying to solve more specific problems.

* You should always remember where you are currently located in your terminal. Check it periodically using the `pwd`, `hostname`, `ifconfig`, `cat /proc/vz/veinfo` commands. One and the same command executed inside a virtual machine or container and on the hardware node can lead to very different results. You can also set up the `PS1` environment variable to show the full path in the `bash` prompt. To do this, add these lines to `/root/.bash_profile`:
+
----
PS1="[\u@\h \w]$ "
export PS1
----
* If the hardware node slows down, use `vmstat`, `ps` (`ps axfw`), `dmesg`, `top` (`vztop`) to find out what is happening, never reboot the machine without investigation. If no thinking helps restore the normal operation, use the Alt+SysRq sequences to dump the memory (`showMem`) and processes (`showPc`).
* Do not run any binary or script that belongs to a container directly from the hardware node, for example, do not ever do this:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*cd /vz/root/99/etc/init.d*
*./httpd status*
----
+
Any script inside a container could have been changed to whatever the container owner chooses: it could have been trojaned, replaced to something like `rm -rf`, etc. You can use only `prlctl exec/prlctl enter` to execute programs inside a container.

* Do not use init scripts on the hardware node. An init script may use `killall` to stop a service, which means that all similar processes will be killed in all containers. You can check `/var/run/Service.pid` and kill the correspondent process explicitly.
* You must be able to detect any rootkit inside a container. It is recommended to use the `chkrootkit` package for detection (you can download the latest version from http://www.chkrootkit.org), or at least run
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*rpm -Va|grep "S.5"*
----
+
to check up if the MD5 sum has changed for any RPM file.
+
You can also run `nmap`, for example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# nmap -p 1-65535 192.168.0.1*
Starting nmap V. 2.54BETA22 ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Interesting ports on  (192.168.0.1):

  state: closed)

22/tcp     open        ssh

111/tcp    open        sunrpc
Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned 
  in 169 seconds
----
+
to check if any ports are open that should normally be closed.
+
That could however be a problem to remove a rootkit from a container and make sure it is 100% removed. If you're not sure, create a new container for that customer and migrate his/her sites and mail there.

* Check the `/var/log/` directory on the hardware node to find out what is happening on the system. There are a number of log files that are maintained by the system and Virtuozzo (the `boot.log`, `messages`, etc.), but other services and programs may also put their own log files here depending on your distribution of Linux and the services and applications that you are running. For example, there may be logs associated with running a mail server (the `maillog` file), automatic tasks (the `cron` file), and others. However, the first place to look into when you are troubleshooting is the `/var/log/messages` log file. It contains the boot messages when the system came up as well as other status messages as the system runs. Errors with I/O, networking, and other general system errors are reported in this file. So, we recommend that you read to the `messages` log file first and then proceed with the other files from the `/var/log/` directory.
* Subscribe to bug tracking lists. You should keep track of new public DoS tools or remote exploits for the software and install them into containers or at hardware nodes.
* When using `iptables`, there is a simple rule for Chains usage to help protect both the hardware node and its containers:
+
--
[options="compact"]
* use INPUT, OUTPUT to filter packets that come in/out the hardware node
* use FORWARD to filter packets that are designated for containers
--

Kernel Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using ALT+SYSRQ Keyboard Sequences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Press ALT+SYSRQ+H and check what is printed at the hardware node console, for example:

----
SysRq: unRaw Boot Sync Unmount showPc showTasks showMem loglevel0-8 tErm kIll \
       killalL Calls Oops
----

This output shows you what ALT+SYSRQ sequences you may use for performing this or that command. The capital letters in the command names identify the sequence. Thus, if there are any troubles with the machine and you're about to reboot it, please use the following key sequences before pressing the *Power* button:

[options="compact"]
* ALT+SYSRQ+M to dump memory info
* ALT+SYSRQ+P to dump processes states
* ALT+SYSRQ+S to sync disks
* ALT+SYSRQ+U to unmount filesystems
* ALT+SYSRQ+L to kill all processes
* ALT+SYSRQ+U try to unmount once again
* ALT+SYSRQ+B to reboot

If the server is not rebooted after that, you can press the *Power* button.

Saving Kernel Faults (OOPS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the following command to check for the kernel messages that should be reported to Virtuozzo developers:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*grep -E "Call Trace|Code" /var/log/messages**
----

Then, you should find kernel-related lines in the corresponding log file and figure out what kernel was booted when the oops occurred. Search backward for the `Linux` string, look for strings like:

----
Sep 26 11:41:12 kernel: Linux version 2.6.18-8.1.1.el5.028stab043.1 \
(root@rhel5-32-build) (gcc version 4.1.1 20061011 (Red Hat 4.1.1-30)) \
#1 SMP Wed Aug 29 11:51:58 MSK 2007
----

An oops usually starts with some description of what happened and ends with the Code string. Here is an example:

----

Finding a Kernel Function That Caused the D Process State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there are too many processes in the D state and you can't find out what is happening, issue the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# objdump -Dr /boot/vmlinux-\`uname -r\` &gt;/tmp/kernel.dump*
----

and then get the process list:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# ps axfwln*
  F UID   PID  PPID PRI NI  VSZ  RSS  WCHAN STAT TTY TIME COMMAND
100   0 20418 20417  17  0 2588  684      - R    ?   0:00 ps axfwln
100   0     1     0   8  0 1388  524 145186 S    ?   0:00 init
040   0  8670     1   9  0 1448  960 145186 S    ?   0:00 syslogd -m 0
040   0  8713     1  10  0 1616 1140 11ea02 S    ?   0:00 crond
----

Look for a number under the *WCHAN* column for the process in question. Then, open `/tmp/kernel.dump` in an editor, find that number in the first column and then scroll backward to the first function name, which can look like this:

----
"c011e910 <sys_nanosleep>:"
----

Then you can tell if the process "lives" or is blocked into the found function.

Container Management Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section includes recommendations on how to solve certain container issues.

Failure to Start a Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An attempt to start a container fails.

*Solution 1*

If there is a message on the system console: `IP address is already used`, issue the `cat /proc/vz/veinfo` command. The information about the container numeric identifier, container class, number of container's processes and container IP address shall be displayed for each running container. This shall also demonstrate that your container is up, i.e. it must be running without any IP address assigned. Set its IP address using the command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --ipadd _&lt;IP_address&gt;_*
----

where _<CT_name>_ is the container name and _<IP_address>_ is the desired IP address.

*Solution 2*

The container might be configured incorrectly. Try to validate the container configuration and find out what parameters have caused the error. Set appropriate values using the `prlctl set` command.

*Solution 3*

The container might have used all its disk quota (disk space). Check the quota (see <<_managing_disk_quotas>>) and adjust its parameters if needed.

*Solution 4*

Run the `prlctl console` utility to log in and get access to the container console. The utility will provide container startup/shutdown output that may be used to pinpoint the problem. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl console MyCT1*
----

where `MyCT1` is the container name.

Failure to Access a Container from Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Solution 1*

The IP address assigned to the container might be already in use in your network. Make sure it is not. The problem container address can be checked by issuing the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# grep IP_ADDRESS /etc/vz/conf/_&lt;UUID&gt;_.conf*
IP_ADDRESS="10.0.186.101"
----

The IP addresses of other containers, which are running, can be checked by running

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# cat /proc/vz/veinfo*
----

*Solution 2*

Make sure the routing to the container is properly configured. containers can use the default router for your network, or you may configure the hardware node as router for its containers.

Failure to Log In to a Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The container starts successfully, but you cannot log in.

*Solution 1*

You are trying to connect via SSH, but access is denied. Probably you have not set the password of the `root` user yet or there is no such user. In this case, use the `prlctl set --userpasswd` command. For example, for the container `MyCT1` you might issue the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyCT1 --userpasswd root:secret*
----

*Solution 2*

Check forwarding settings by issuing the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/venet0/forwarding*
----

If it is `0` then change it to `1` by issuing the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/venet0/forwarding*
----

Getting Technical Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get technical support via the mailing list, bug tracker, and support forum. For more information, visit https://openvz.org/Support.
