Virtuozzo 7 is a virtualization solution that allows you to run multiple virtual machines and containers on a single physical server.
  
This chapter provides general information about Virtuozzo and this guide.

About Virtuozzo 7 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
Virtuozzo 7 is a virtualization solution that allows you to simultaneously run multiple Virtuozzo virtual machines and containers on a single physical server. With Virtuozzo, you can efficiently share your server's hardware resources among virtual machines and containers.
  
Virtuozzo is installed directly on the server hardware and does not need any operating system to function. Once it is installed, Virtuozzo allows you to create virtual machines and containers and manage them using the following tools:

[options="compact"]
* *Virtuozzo command-line interface (CLI)*. The command-line interface comprises a set of Virtuozzo command-line utilities that you can use to manage virtual machines and containers, both locally and remotely.
* *Virtual Automation*. Virtual Automation is a remote management tool that allows you to manage physical servers and their virtual machines and containers with the help of a standard Web browser on any platform.
  
Graphically, a server with the Virtuozzo software installed can be represented as follows:

Managing Virtuozzo 7 
--------------------

This chapter provides instructions on configuration files, scripts, and command-line utilities that can used to configure the settings related to the Virtuozzo software and the hardware node.

  
Virtuozzo Configuration Files 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
The table below lists the configuration files available in Virtuozzo 7. Most files are located in the `/etc` directory on a hardware node. Some configuration files are stored on other servers (e.g., on a Backup Node). If a configuration file is stored in a place other than the hardware node, its exact location is specified.

[options="header",cols="2a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`/etc/vz/vz.conf`|Global configuration file. This file keeps system-wide settings, such as the default location of templates and global network settings.
|+/etc/vz/conf/_&lt;CT_name&gt;_.conf+|Private configuration file of a container with the ID +_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+. This file keeps container-specific settings: resource management parameters, the location of its private area, IP address, and so on.
|+/etc/vz/conf/ve-_&lt;name&gt;_.conf-sample+|Sample files containing a number of default container configurations. Some pre-created samples file are shipped with Virtuozzo (e.g., `basic` and `confixx`), but you can also create your own samples to meet your demands.
|+/etc/vz/conf/dists/_&lt;distribution_name&gt;_.conf+|Linux distribution configuration files. These files define what scripts should be run when you perform specific operations with containers (e.g., when you set a new IP address for a container). The scripts differ from Virtuozzo action scripts and depend on the Linux version a particular container is running.
|`/etc/vz/pfcache.conf`|Configuration file used by the `pfcache` utility to manage memory and IOPS deduplication.
|`/etc/vz/oom-groups.conf`|OOM killer configuration file with task badness adjustments.
|`/etc/vz/conf/networks_classes`|Configuration file defining the network classes for traffic shaping and bandwidth management.
|`/etc/vzvpn/vzvpn.conf`|Configuration file defining the parameters for establishing a private secure channel to the Virtuozzo support server.
|`/etc/sysctl.conf`|Kernel parameters. Virtuozzo adjusts a number of kernel `sysctl` parameters and modifies the default `/etc/sysctl.conf` file.
|`/etc/vzredirect.d/*.conf`|Configuration files defining offline management modes administrators use to access their containers.
|`/etc/vzlmond.conf`|Configuration file the `vzlmond` daemon uses to collect information on how much resources the server consumes at the moment.
|`/etc/vzstat.conf`|Configuration file listing the warning and error levels for resource control parameters. If a parameter hits the warning or error value set for it, the `pstat` utility will display this parameter in yellow or red.
|`/etc/vzbackup.conf`|Configuration file located on the Backup Node and determining the global backup settings for containers. Note that the settings in this file do not apply to virtual machines.
|`/etc/vzpkgpoxy/vzpkgproxy.conf`|Configuration file used by the `vzpkgproxy` utility to create special caching proxy servers for OS and application EZ templates. The file can be located on any computer where the `vzpkgproxy` package is installed.
|`/etc/vztt/vztt.conf`|Configuration file used by the `vzpkg` utility to manage OS and application EZ templates.
|`/etc/vzstatrep.conf`|Configuration file stored on the Monitor Node and used by the `vzstatrep` utility when generating statistic reports and graphics on the hardware node resource consumption and sending these reports to the server administrator.
|`/etc/shaman/shaman.conf`|Configuration file the `shaman` utility uses to manage and monitor High Availability clusters.

Global Virtuozzo Configuration File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Virtuozzo keeps its system wide configuration parameters in the `/etc/vz/vz.conf` configuration file. This file is in shell format. Keep in mind that Virtuozzo scripts source this file - thus, shell commands in this file will cause system to execute them under root account. Parameters in this file are presented in the form `PARAMETER="value"`. Logically all the parameters belong to the following groups: global parameters, logging, disk quotas, template, network traffic, containers, validation and overcommitment, supplementary parameters, and name-based hosting parameters. Below is the description of all the parameters defined in this version of Virtuozzo.

[options="header",cols="2a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`VIRTUOZZO`|This can be either `yes` or `no`. Virtuozzo System V startup script checks this parameter. If set to `no`, then Virtuozzo modules are not loaded. You might set it to "no" if you want to perform system maintenance and do not want to bring up all containers on the server.|`yes`
|`HTTP_PROXY`|Specifies either the hostname or the IP address of the HTTP proxy server. After setting this parameter and in case you use an HTTP proxy server for handling all HTTP requests, the Virtuozzo utilities communicating with the outer world through HTTP will use this server for managing all your HTTP messages.|n/a
|`ACTIONLOGDIR`|This is the directory where `prlctl` keeps a log of its actions in the format suitable for Virtuozzo statistics daemon `hwcoll`.|`/vz/actionlog`
|`LOCKDIR`|Actions on a container should be serialized, since two simultaneous operations on the same container may break its consistency. Virtuozzo keeps lock files in this directory in order to serialize access to one container.|`/vz/lock`
|`REMOVEMIGRATED`|Specifies whether the private area and the configuration file of the container moved to a new server with the `pmigrate` command should be destroyed on the Source Server (the value of the parameter is set to `yes`) or renamed to have the `.migrated` suffix (the value of the parameter is set to `no`). You may wish to leave the container private area and the configuration file to make migration faster. This configuration value can be overridden by the `pmigrate` command-line options.|`no`
|`VE0CPUUNITS`|CPU weight designated for the server itself.|`1000`
|`OFFLINE_MANAGEMENT`|Specifies whether containers can be managed by the container administrator by means of the services indicated in the `OFFLINE_SERVICE` parameter.|`yes`
|`OFFLINE_SERVICE`|These services correspond to the names of the files in the `/etc/vzredirect.d` directory, each file defining at what port the service will be accessible and to what container the requests coming to this port will be redirected. These services will be accessible to those containers which have the `OFFLINE_MANAGEMENT` parameter set to "`yes`".|`vzpp-plesk vzpp`
|`BURST_CPU_AVG_USAGE`|The CPU usage limit, in percent, set for the container. This limit is calculated as the ratio of the current container CPU usage to the CPU limit (i.e to the value of the `CPULIMIT` parameter) set for the container in its configuration file. If the limit is not specified, the full CPU power of the server is considered as the CPU limit. Upon exceeding the `BURST_CPU_AVG_USAGE` limit, the `BURST_CPULIMIT` limit is applied to the given container.

This parameter can be redefined by the `BURST_CPU_AVG_USAGE` parameter set in the container configuration file.|`disabled`
|`BURST_CPULIMIT`|The CPU power limit, in percent, the container cannot exceed. The limitations set in this parameter are applied to any container exceeding the limit specified in the `BURST_CPU_AVG_USAGE` parameter.

This parameter can be redefined by the `BURST_CPULIMIT` parameter set in the container configuration file.|&nbsp;

|`VEFSTYPE`|File system to use when caching OS templates:

[options="compact"]
* *ext4*: Use to create containers with the new layout.
* *vz4*: Use to create legacy containers.|`ext4`
|`VZMOUNTS`|Defines the partitions which will be automatically mounted by the `/etc/init.d/vz` script after the server boot. This script will check (by calling the `fsck` utility) and mount all the partitions specified as the value of this parameter, listed in `/etc/fstab` file on the server, and having the `noauto` flag set for them in this file.|`/vz`
|`IPV6`|Defines whether the IPv6 support is enabled on the hardware node.|`yes`
|`GOLDEN_IMAGE`|Enables (`yes`) or disables (`no`) embedding application templates into OS EZ template cache prior to creating containers based on this cache.|`yes`
|`PFCACHE`|Path to the memory and IOPS deduplication cache with common container files.|`/vz/pfcache`
|`PFCACHE_IMAGE`|Path to the private area of the memory and IOPS deduplication cache.|`/vz/pfcache.hdd`
|`PFCACHE_IMAGE_SIZE`|Image size (in 1KB blocks) of the memory and IOPS deduplication cache.|`10485760`
|`PFCACHE_INCLUDES`|Directories for which memory and IOPS deduplication is enabled by default.|`bin lib lib64 opt sbin usr`
|`VZ_TOOLS_MEMLIMIT`|Limits the total memory consumption of all `vz` utilities, e.g., `vzbackup`, `vzmigrate`, etc. Set in bytes.|&nbsp;

|`2`|Level 0 and level 1 logging events, plus template version used for container creation and calls to mount and quota operations with parameters.
|====

.Disk quota parameters
[options="header",cols="1a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`DISK_QUOTA`|Enables or disables disk quotas for containers. If set to `no` then disk space accounting will be disabled.|`yes`
|====

.SLM parameters
[options="header",cols="1a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`SLM`|If set to `yes`, the SLM modules are loaded to the server. It means that the `slmmemorylimit` parameter is supported and can be used to manage the amount of memory consumed by every container on the server.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* After changing this parameter, restart the Virtuozzo service for the changes to take effect.
====
|`yes`
|`SLMPATTERN`|Defines the SLM pattern rules for grouping the processes running inside containers on the server. The default rules are set in the `/etc/vzslm.d/default.conf` file on the server.|`default`

.Network traffic parameters
[options="header",cols="1a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`TRAFFIC_SHAPING`|Traffic shaping allows you to limit the bandwidth consumed by containers for outgoing traffic. If it is set to "yes", then limitations will be turned on. If you want to use this feature, `TRAFFIC_ACCOUNTING` should be set to `yes` as well.|`no`
|`BANDWIDTH`|This is the list of network interfaces on which we want to shape the traffic and their speed in the form of "dev:rate". The rate is measured in Kbps. If you want to shape traffic on more than one interface, set this parameter to `dev1:rate1 dev2:rate2`. For example, for two 100&nbsp;Mbps Ethernet cards, set it to `eth0:102400 eth1:102400`.|`eth0:102400`
|`TOTALRATE`|This parameter sets the size of the bandwidth pool for all containers. It is the upper limit for the bandwidth available to all your containers and is specified in the form of "dev:class:rate". The rate is measured in Kbps. Containers can consume bandwidth up to this limit in addition to the limit specified by the `RATE` parameter. Default value corresponds to 4&nbsp;Mbps limit for the Class 1 containers.|`eth0:1:4096`
|`RATE`|This parameter is the default bandwidth guaranteed to a container for outgoing traffic if the container configuration file does not explicitly specify a different value. This value is in the same format as `TOTALRATE` and its default value is "eth0:1:8". The rate is measured in Kbps. Note that 8&nbsp;Kbps, offered by the default configuration, is the guarantee and the container cannot consume less than this value and more than the sum of this value and `TOTALRATE`.|`eth0:1:8`
|`VZ_TOOLS_BCID`|Enables limits for `pbackup`, `prestore`, and `pmigrate` operations. Make sure that the value of this parameter does not coincide with the ID assigned to some of your containers. For example, if you leave the default value 2, ensure that no container with ID 2 exists on the Node.|&nbsp;
|`VZ_TOOLS_IOLIMIT`|Sets the disk I/O limit for the backup, restore, and migration operations, in bytes per second. Not set by default.|&nbsp;
|====

.Template parameters

[options="header",cols="4a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`VE_VALIDATE_ACTION`|Defines whether the container configuration should be validated when a container is started. If this parameter is set to "warning", a warning is displayed in case of misconfiguration. If set to "error", the container is not started in case of misconfiguration. If set to "fix", the configuration is automatically corrected.|`none`
|`OVERCOMMITMENT_ACTION`|Defines whether the server should be checked for the overcommitment of resources when a container is started. If this parameter is set to "warning", a warning is displayed in case of overcommitment. If set to "error", the container that would cause overcommitment is not started. When checking for overcommitment, the following five parameters are checked.|`none`

Container Configuration File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Each container has its own configuration file, which is stored in the `/etc/vz/conf` directory and has a name like +_&lt;CT_name&gt;_.conf+. This file has the same format as the global configuration file. The settings specified in this file can be subdivided into the following categories:

[options="compact"]
* miscellaneous,
* resource management parameters,
* networking,
* backup.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* In Virtuozzo, you can also configure a number of settings for the server itself by editing the `/etc/vz/conf/0.conf` file. Currently, these settings include the `VERSION` and `ONBOOT` parameters, as well as all parameters listed in the table under the _System parameters_ group.
====

Miscellaneous Parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
The table below list the miscellaneous parameters you can set in the configuration file of a container:

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`VERSION`|Specifies the Virtuozzo version the configuration file applies to. `2` relates to Virtuozzo version 4 and later.
|`ONBOOT`|Specifies whether the container should be started automatically on system startup. Virtuozzo automatically starts all containers that have this parameter set to "yes" upon startup.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* If `yes` is specified as the value of this parameter in the `0.conf` file, all server system management parameters are set on the server boot to the values indicated in this file.
====
|`OFFLINE_MANAGEMENT`|Overrides the `OFFLINE_MANAGEMENT` parameter from the global configuration file.
|`OFFLINE_SERVICE`|Overrides the `OFFLINE_SERVICE` parameter from the global configuration file.
|`ALLOWREBOOT`|Specifies whether the container may be restarted with the `reboot` command run from inside. If omitted or set to `yes`, restarting is allowed.
|`CAPABILITY`|Specifies capabilities inside the container. You can set the following capabilities: `AUDIT_WRITE`, `CHOWN`, `DAC_OVERRIDE`, `DAC_READ_SEARCH`, `FOWNER`, `FS_MASK`, `FSETID`, `IPC_LOCK`, `IPC_OWNER`, `KILL`, `LEASE`, `LINUX_IMMUTABLE`, `MKNOD`, `NET_ADMIN`, `NET_BIND_SERVICE`, `NET_BROADCAST`, `NET_RAW`, `SETGID`, `SETFCAP`, `SETPCAP`, `SETUID`, `SYS_ADMIN`, `SYS_BOOT`, `SYS_CHROOT`, `SYS_MODULE`, `SYS_NICE`, `SYS_PACCT`, `SYS_PTRACE`, `SYS_RAWIO`, `SYS_RESOURCE`, `SYS_TIME`, `SYS_TTY_CONFIG`, `VE_ADMIN`.
|`OSTEMPLATE`|The name of the OS template that was used for creating the container. You do not have to change this parameter; `prlctl` will set it for you upon calling the `prlctl create` command (or using the defaults from the global configuration file). The `.` symbol before the OS template name, if specified, indicates that this is an EZ OS template.
|`TEMPLATES`|In a configuration file of an existing container, this parameter lists application templates installed with the `prlctl create`, `vzpkgadd`, or `vzpkg install` commands. In this case you should not modify it, because it is used by template management utilities to track installation history. This parameter is omitted if no templates have been installed to the container.
|`VE_ROOT`|Overrides the `VE_ROOT` parameter from the global configuration file.
|`VE_PRIVATE`|Overrides the `VE_PRIVATE` parameter from the global configuration file.
|`VE_ENVIRONMENT`|Overrides the `VE_ENVIRONMENT` parameter from the global configuration file.
|`TECHNOLOGIES`|Determines a set of technologies which should be provided by the Virtuozzo kernel for container operation. Currently, this parameter can contain the information about the following technologies:

[options="compact"]
* The system architecture of the container (`x86`, `x86_64`, or `i64`).
* Whether the container is based on the OS template supporting the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL). In this case, the `nptl` entry is specified as the value of this parameter.
* Whether the OS EZ template the container is based on requires the `sysfs` filesystem support (e.g., the OS EZ template for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10).
|`DISABLED`|If set to `yes`, disables the container making it impossible to start the container once it was stopped. You can start the disabled container by setting the value of this parameter to `no` or using the `--force` option with the `prlctl set` command.
|`DESCRIPTION`|Sets the description for the container.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* You are allowed to use only symbols in the 'A-z' and '0-9' ranges in your descriptions.
====
|`NAME`|The name assigned to the container. You can use this name, along with the container ID, to refer to the container while performing this or that container-related operation on the server. Follow the following rules while setting the container name:

[options="compact"]
* The name should contain the `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `\`, `-`, and `_` symbols only.
* If the name consists of two or more words, it should be quoted (e.g., `My container 101`).
|`ORIGIN_SAMPLE`|The configuration sample the container was based on when created.
|`CONFIG_CUSTOMIZED`|Indicates whether any of the container configuration parameters have been modified as regards its original configuration sample. If this parameter is omitted, its value is considered as `no`.
|`UUID`|The container unique identifier. This identifier is used by certain Virtuozzo utilities during their execution.
|====

Resource Management Parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
All resource management parameters can be subdivided into the CPU, disk, system, and VSwap categories for your convenience. Any parameter can be set with the `prlctl set` command and the corresponding option name (in the lower case, e.g., `--kmemsize` for `KMEMSIZE`, etc.). See <<_managing_containers>> for more details. The *Typical value* column, if present, specifies a range of reasonable parameter values for different applications, from light to huge heavy loaded containers. If the barrier and limit fields are in use, ranges for both thresholds are given.
  
.CPU Parameters
[options="header",cols="2a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Parameter|Description|Typical value
|`CPUUNITS`|CPU weight. This is a positive integer number that defines how much CPU time the container can get as compared to the other virtual machines and containers running on the server. The larger the number, the more CPU time the container can receive. Possible values range from 8 to 500000. If this parameter is not set, the default value of 1000 is used.|`250...1000`
|`CPULIMIT`, `CPULIMIT_MHZ`|CPU limit, in per cent  (`CPULIMIT`) or megahertz (`CPULIMIT_MHZ`), the container is not allowed to exceed. The parameter is not set for newly created containers; so they can consume all free CPU power of the server. When setting this parameter in per cent, keep in mind that one CPU core makes up 100%. So if the server has 4 CPU cores, the total CPU power will equal 400%.|&nbsp;
|`CPUS`|Number of CPU cores defining the CPU limit for a container. The limit is calculated by multiplying the power of one CPU core by the number of the specified CPU cores. This option also defines the number of CPUs shown to users from inside a container. This parameter is not set for newly created containers; so they can consume all free CPU power of the server.|&nbsp;
|`CPUMASK`|The CPU affinity mask defining which CPUs on the Node can be used to handle the processes running in the container. The CPU mask can be specified as both separate CPU index numbers (1,2,3) and CPU ranges (2-4,5-7).|&nbsp;
|`NODEMASK`|The NUMA node mask defining a NUMA node to bind the container to. Once you set the mask, the processes running in the container will be executed only on the CPUs that belong to the specified NUMA node.|&nbsp;
|`BURST_CPU_AVG_USAGE`|CPU usage limit, in percent, set for the container. This limit is calculated as the ratio of the current container CPU usage to the CPU limit (i.e to the value of the `CPULIMIT` parameter) set for the container in its configuration file. If the limit is not specified, the full CPU power of the server is considered as the CPU limit. Upon exceeding the `BURST_CPU_AVG_USAGE` limit, the `BURST_CPULIMIT` limit is applied to the container. This parameter redefines the `BURST_CPU_AVG_USAGE` parameter set in the Virtuozzo configuration file.|`disabled`
|`BURST_CPULIMIT`|CPU power limit, in per cent, the container cannot exceed. The limitations set in this parameter are applied to the container when it exceeds the limit specified in the `BURST_CPU_AVG_USAGE` parameter. This parameter redefines the `BURST_CPULIMIT` parameter specified in the Virtuozzo configuration file.|&nbsp;
|====

.Disk Parameters
[options="header",cols="2a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Parameter|Description|Typical value
|`DISKSPACE`|Total size of disk space that can be consumed by the container, in 1 KB blocks.|`204800...10485760-
204800...11534340`
|`QUOTAUGIDLIMIT`|This parameter enables (if set to a value other than `0`) or disables (if set to `0`) per-user and per-group quotas for further management with the standard Linux `quota` utility. Enabling per-user and per-group quotas for a container requires restarting the container.|`0...N`
|`IOPRIO`|The container priority for disk I/O operations. The higher the priority, the more time the container has for writing to and reading from the disk. The default container priority is 4.|`0-7`
|`IOPSLIMIT`|The maximum number of disk input and output operations per second a container is allowed to perform. By default, any newly created container does not have the IOPS limit set and can perform so many disk I/O operations per second as necessary.|&nbsp;
|`IOLIMIT`|The bandwidth a container is allowed to use for its disk input and output (I/O) operations. By default, the limit is set in megabytes per second. However, you can use the following suffixes to use other measurement units:

[options="compact"]
* `G` - sets the limit in gigabytes per second.
* `K` - sets the limit in kilobytes per second.
* `B` - sets the limit in bytes per second.

In the current version of Virtuozzo, the maximum I/O bandwidth limit you can set for a container is 2 GB per second.

The default I/O bandwidth limit for all newly created containers is set to 0, which means that no limits are applied to any containers.|&nbsp;
|====

.System Parameters
[options="header",cols="1a,3a,2a"]
|====
|Parameter|Description|Typical value

UDP and other sockets may also be used in some very special applications (SNMP agents and others).|`40...500`
|`VMGUARPAGES`|Memory allocation guarantee, in pages. Applications are guaranteed to be able to allocate memory while the amount of memory accounted as `privvmpages` does not exceed the configured barrier of the `vmguarpages` parameter. Above the barrier, memory allocation is not guaranteed and may fail in case of overall memory shortage.|`1725...107520`

196608...4194304`
|`PHYSPAGES`|Total size of RAM used by processes. This parameter is used for accounting purposes only. It shows the usage of RAM by the container. For memory pages used by several different containers (mappings of shared libraries, for example), only a fraction of a page is charged to each container. The sum of the `physpages` for all containers corresponds to the total number of pages used in the system by all accounted users.|`Not limited`

Networking Parameters
+++++++++++++++++++++
  
Network-related parameters allow you to set bandwidth management parameters, hostname and IP addresses that a container can use, and other parameters.

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`HOSTNAME`|If this parameter is specified, then `prlctl` will set the hostname to its value upon the next container start. This parameter can be omitted. In this case, the container administrator should configure the hostname manually.
|`IP_ADDRESS`|This is the list of IP addresses, which can be used on container network interfaces. This list is an argument of the container start call and it is impossible to assign IP address from inside the container if the address is not on the list. Any IP address assigned from within the container will be visible only within the container.
|`NAMESERVER`|The IP address of the DNS server the container is supposed to use. More than one server can be specified in the space-separated format.
|`SEARCHDOMAIN`|DNS search domains for the container. More than one domain can be specified.
|`NETDEV`|The names of physical network adapters that have been moved from the server to the given container.
|`NETFILTER`|Indicates which `iptables` modules are allowed for the container. If some of the allowed modules are not loaded on the destination Hardware Node after migration or restoration from backup, they will be automatically loaded on the migrated or restored container start. The following modes are available:

[options="compact"]
* `disabled`: none.
* `stateless`: (default) all modules except `conntrack` and NAT-related.
* `stateful`: all modules except NAT-related.
* `full`: all modules.
|`NETIF`|Specifies a number of parameters for the virtual network adapters existing inside the container. These parameters include:

[options="compact"]
* `ifname`: the name of the `veth` virtual Ethernet interface inside the container.
* `mac`: the MAC address assigned to the `veth` virtual Ethernet interface inside the container.
* `host_mac`: the MAC address assigned to the `veth` virtual Ethernet interface on the server.
* `network`: the name of the virtual network where the `veth` virtual network adapter is included.
* `ip`: the IP address(es) assigned to the `veth` virtual network adapter.
|`RATE`|If traffic shaping is turned on, then this parameter specifies bandwidth guarantee, in Kbps, for the container. The parameters should be set in the form of `eth0:1:8`.
|`RATEBOUND`|If set to `yes`, the bandwidth guarantee is also the limit for the container, and the container cannot borrow the bandwidth from the `TOTALRATE` bandwidth pool.
|====

Backup Parameters
+++++++++++++++++
  
Backup-related parameters, if present, allow you to specify the number of backups to store. If absent, these parameters are taken from the global backup configuration file or the backup configuration file for a particular server.

[options="header",cols="2a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`BACKUP_CHAIN_LEN`|An incremental backup parameter. After this number of incremental backups, a full backup is performed.|`7`
|`BACKUP_CHAIN_DAYS`|An incremental backup parameter. After this number of days a full backup is performed.|`7`
|`BACKUP_KEEP_MAX`|The number of backups to store. Only full and plain full backups are accounted. If a regular backup is being performed that exceeds this number, the oldest backup is automatically deleted. This parameter is effective only if the `-p` option is specified with the `vzbackup` utility. If there is no `-p` option, the number of backups to store is not limited whatever the value of this parameter.|`3`
|====

Linux Distribution Configuration Files 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Some Virtuozzo tools (e.g., `prlctl`) need to run special scripts inside a container to perform certain operations on it. However, carrying out one and the same operation inside containers running different Linux versions may require execution of different actions. This may be caused by the fact that different Linux distributions store files in different locations, use different commands to complete one and the same task, and so on. To distinguish between containers running different Linux versions and to determine what scripts should be executed while performing the relevant container-related operations, Virtuozzo uses special distribution configuration files located in the `/etc/vz/conf/dists` directory on the server.
  
There are a number of distribution configuration files shipped with Virtuozzo by default (`centos.conf`, `fedora-core.conf`, `gentoo.conf`, etc.). To view all configuration files available on your Virtuozzo, you can go to the `/etc/vz/conf/dists` directory and issue the `ls` command. The distribution configuration files will be displayed in the form of +_&lt;Linux_distribution&gt;_-_&lt;version&gt;_.conf+ where +_&lt;Linux_distribution&gt;_+ and +_&lt;version&gt;_+ denote the name of the Linux distribution and its version, respectively (e.g., `centos-7.conf`).
  
Any distribution configuration file consists of a number of entries in the form of +_&lt;parameter_name&gt;_=_&lt;script_name&gt;_+ where +_&lt;parameter_name&gt;_+ denotes the name of the parameter defining the operation when the script in the right part of the entry is to be executed and +_&lt;script_name&gt;_+ is the name of the script to be run on performing the operation defined by the parameter in the left part of the entry. In the current version of Virtuozzo, the following parameters are used to define what scripts should be executed for the corresponding Linux version a container is running:

* `ADD_IP`: the script specified as the value of this parameter has the default name of +_&lt;distribution_name&gt;_-add_ip.sh+ and is used to configure the network settings during the container startup and the IP address(es) assignment. The script is launched inside the container on executing the following commands:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl start _&lt;CT_name&gt;_
prlctl set _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --ipadd _&lt;IP_address&gt;_
prlctl set _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --ipadd _&lt;IP_address&gt;_ --ipdel all
----
* `DEL_IP`: the script specified as the value of this parameter has the default name of +_&lt;distribution_name&gt;_-del_ip.sh+ and is used to delete an existing IP address from the container. The script is launched inside the container on executing the following commands:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl set _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --ipdel _&lt;IP_address&gt;_
prlctl set _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --ipdel all
----
* `SET_HOSTNAME`: the script specified as the value of this parameter has the default name of +_&lt;distribution_name&gt;_-set_hostname.sh+ and is used to configure the hostname of the container. The script is launched inside the container on executing the following command:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl set _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --hostname _&lt;name&gt;_
----
* `SET_DNS`: the script specified as the value of this parameter has the default name of +_&lt;distribution_name&gt;_-set_dns.sh+ and is used to configure DNS parameters in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. The script is launched inside the container on executing the following command:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl set _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --searchdomain _&lt;domain&gt;_ --nameserver _&lt;IP_address&gt;_
----
* `SET_USERPASS`: the script specified as the value of this parameter has the default name of +_&lt;distribution_name&gt;_-set_userpass.sh+ and is used to add a new user or change the current password. The script is launched inside the container on executing the following command:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl set _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --userpasswd __&lt;user&gt;__:__&lt;passwd&gt;__
----
* `SET_UGID_QUOTA`: the script specified as the value of this parameter has the default name of +_&lt;distribution_name&gt;_-set_ugid_quota.sh+ and is used to set up per-user/group quota. The script is launched inside the container on executing the following command:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl set _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --quotaugidlimit _&lt;num&gt;_
----
* `POST_CREATE`: the script specified as the value of this parameter has the default name of +_&lt;distribution_name&gt;_-postcreate.sh+ and is used to perform certain tasks (e.g., to modify the `crontab` files) after the container creation. This script is launched on the server on executing the following command:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl create _&lt;CT_name&gt;_
----
* `POST_MIGRATE`: the script specified as the value of this parameter has the default name of +_&lt;distribution_name&gt;_-post_migrate.sh+ and is used to perform certain operations on the container where the physical server has been successfully migrated. This script is launched inside the container on executing the following command:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzp2v [+_&lt;options&gt;_+] --ctid _&lt;CT_name&gt;_
----
  
The scripts specified in distribution configuration files are located in the `/etc/vz/conf/dists/scripts` directory on the server and executed on performing the aforementioned operations on the containers. After an operation has been initiated, the `prlctl` or `vzp2v` utility turns to the corresponding container configuration file, looks for the value of the `DISTRIBUTION` variable or, if the latter is not present, of the `OSTEMPLATE` variable in this file, and defines on their basis what Linux version the given container is running. After that, `prlctl` reads the corresponding configuration file for the determined Linux version from the `/etc/vz/conf/dists` directory and executes the scripts specified in this file.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* If no distribution is specified as the value of the `DISTRIBUTION` and `OSTEMPLATE` variables in the container configuration file or no configuration file for the given Linux version was found in the `/etc/vz/conf/dists` directory, the `default` file from this directory is used.
====

Memory and IOPS Deduplication Configuration File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Contained in the `/etc/vz/pfcache.conf` file, memory and IOPS deduplication parameters allow you to tailor cache behavior and performance to your needs.
  
.Parameters
[options="header",cols="2a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`COUNT`|The minimum number of file copies required for the file to become cacheable. Copies may exist in the same container or different containers.|`2`
|`MINSIZE`|Minimal cacheable file size, bytes. Files smaller than this value will not be cached.|`0`
|`MAXSIZE`|Maximal cacheable file size, bytes. Files larger than this value will not be cached.|`2147483648`
|`TIMEOUT`|Time between caching attempts, seconds.|`5`
|`PFCACHE_IOLIMIT`|Memory and IOPS deduplication cache IO bandwidth limit, bps. Unlimited by default.|&nbsp;
|`PFCACHE_IOPSLIMIT`|Memory and IOPS deduplication cache IOPS limit. Unlimited by default.|&nbsp;
|`LOGLEVEL`|Logging verbosity. Messages are logged in the system log file `/var/log/messages`.|`1`
|`PAGEMIN`|The total number of memory pages used in containers:

[options="compact"]
* `0` - Cache even files without memory pages.
* `1` - Cache only files in use.
* `N` - Cache only when the total number of memory pages in containers reaches N.|`1`
|`PURGEAHEAD`|Extra cache space to free up in addition to the requested space. In per cent of the requested space. Used with the `pfcache purge --size` command.|`20%`
|====

Network Classes Definition File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
In Virtuozzo, both traffic accounting and bandwidth management are based on network classes. The network classes’ definition file (`/etc/vz/conf/networks_classes`) describes network classes that Virtuozzo recognizes. Currently, there can be up to 15 classes defined.
  
The lines in this file have the following format:
  
[subs="quotes"]
----
_&lt;class_ID&gt;_ _&lt;IP_address&gt;_/_&lt;prefix_length&gt;_
----
  
where +_&lt;class_ID&gt;_+ defines the network class identifier, +_&lt;IP_address&gt;_+ defines the starting IP address, and +_&lt;prefix_length&gt;_+ defines the subnet mask. In pair +_&lt;IP_address&gt;_+ and +_&lt;prefix_length&gt;_+ define the range of IP addresses for this class. There may be several lines for each class. Classes should be defined after Class 1 and represent exceptions from the "matching-everything" rule of Class 1. Class 0 has a special meaning and defines the IP ranges for which no accounting is done (this server container addresses).
  
The definition of class 1 is required; any class except class 1 can be omitted. However, it is recommended to define class 0 correctly as it will improve performance. For example:
  
[subs="quotes"]
----
# HW node VPS's networks
0 10.10.10.0/24
0 10.10.15.0/24
# all IP("local" traffic)
1 0.0.0.0/0
# class 2 - "foreign" traffic
#2 10.0.0.0/8
#2 11.0.0.0/8
# inside "foreign" network there
# is a hole with "local" traffic
#1 10.10.16.0/24

----
+_&lt;parameter_name&gt;_=_&lt;parameter_value&gt;_+
----
  
.Parameters
[options="header",cols="2a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`REMOTE_HOST`|Mandatory. The hostname or the IP address of the Virtuozzo support server.
|`REMOTE_PORT`|Mandatory. The port number of the Virtuozzo support server to be used for establishing a virtual private network (VPN).
|`STARTTMO`|Mandatory. The time, in seconds, during which there will be attempts to start the Virtuozzo support tool if it could not be started immediately after its launching.
|`INACTIVE`|Mandatory. The time of inactivity, in seconds, after which the connection between your server and the Virtuozzo support server will be closed.
|`PING`|Mandatory. The time, in seconds, at the end of which the port of the Virtuozzo support server will be pinged in case no packets have been received from the support server during the time specified.
|`PING_EXIT`|Mandatory. The time, in seconds, after a lapse of which the connection between your server and the Virtuozzo support server will be closed in case no ping signals or other packets have been received from the support server during this time.

The hostname or the IP address and the port number of the HTTP proxy server through which a VPN between your server and the Virtuozzo support server is to be established. This parameter overrides the `HTTP_PROXY` parameter set in the `/etc/vz/vz.conf` file on the server. If the `HTTP_PROXY` parameter is not specified in either of the files, the Virtuozzo support tool looks for the `http_proxy` environment variable on the server and takes its value for establishing a VPN.
|`HTTP_PROXY_USER`|Optional. The user name used by the HTTP proxy server for your authentication.
|`HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD`|Optional. The password of the user specified in the `HTTP_PROXY_USER` parameter and used for your authentication by the HTTP proxy server.

Kernel Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
There is a number of kernel limits that should be set for the Virtuozzo software to work correctly. Virtuozzo is shipped with a tuned `/etc/sysctl.conf` file. Understanding what parameters were changed is essential for running the required number of containers. Below is the contents of the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file as shipped with Virtuozzo:

[subs="quotes"]
----
# Controls IP packet forwarding
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
# Controls source route verification
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
# Do not accept source routing
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
# Controls the System Request debugging functionality of the kernel
kernel.sysrq = 1
# Controls whether core dumps will append the PID to the core filename.
# Useful for debugging multi-threaded applications.
kernel.core_uses_pid = 1
# Controls the use of TCP syncookies
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
# Disable netfilter on bridges.
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 0
# Controls the default maxmimum size of a mesage queue
kernel.msgmnb = 65536
# Controls the maximum size of a message, in bytes
kernel.msgmax = 65536
# Controls the maximum shared segment size, in bytes
kernel.shmmax = 68719476736
# Controls the maximum number of shared memory segments, in pages
kernel.shmall = 4294967296
net.ipv6.conf.all.proxy_ndp=1
net.ipv4.conf.default.proxy_arp = 0
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 0
fs.super-max = 2560
fs.file-max = 262144
kernel.fairsched-nodes-max = 1538
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2 = 2048
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3 = 4096
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.neigh.default.gc_thresh2 = 2048
net.ipv6.neigh.default.gc_thresh3 = 4096
net.nf_conntrack_max = 500000
fs.aio-max-nr = 1048576
----

Notice that some parameters of the kernel configuration depends on the maximum number of containers you plan to run. In the default configuration file, these numbers were calculated under the assumption the maximum container number is 512. If you plan to run another number of containers, it is recommended to recalculate `net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2` and `net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3` parameters as three per container plus 128...512. Keep the second parameter twice as great as the first one.
  
To apply the changes issue the following command:
  
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# sysctl -p*
----
  
Besides, it makes sense to set `net.ipv4.tcp_use_sg` to `0`, since the corresponding "Scatter/gather IO" feature is not supported by the `venet` device, used in Virtuozzo networking.
  
It is also worth mentioning that normally you should have forwarding turned on since the server forwards packets destined to or originated from containers.

  
Offline Management Configuration Files 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
The offline management configuration files located in the `/etc/vzredirect.d` directory define various modes of container offline management by container administrators. One configuration file describes one offline management mode. In the current Virtuozzo version, two files are accessible: `vzpp.conf` and `vzpp-plesk.conf`. The first file defines the container offline management by means of Power Panel, and the second one by means of the same Power Panel with an integrated Plesk control panel.
  
There are two parameters in each of the files.

|Name|Description|Example

|`PORT`|This port must be entered in the address line of an Internet browser after the container IP address when managing the container by means of Power Panel or the Plesk control panel.|`PORT=8443`
|`DST_VEID`|The ID of the container where the requests coming to the specified port will be redirected.|`DST_VEID=1`
|====

vzlmond Configuration File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
The `/etc/vzlmond.conf` file defines the configuration parameters for the `vzlmond` daemon used to periodically check and log the state of your server. The gathered logs can then be used by the `vzstatrep` utility to generate statistic reports and graphics on their basis and to send these reports and graphics to the server administrator's e-mail address(es). For more details on the `vzstatrep` utility, See <<_vzstatrep>>.
  
The parameters in this file are presented on separate lines in the following format:
  
[subs="quotes"]
----
__&lt;parameter_name&gt;__=__&lt;parameter_value&gt;__
----
  
.Parameters
[options="header",cols="2a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`STATS_VMSTAT_PERIOD`|The periodicity, in seconds, with which the `vmstat` utility is run on the server and its output is saved to log files in the directory specified as the value of the `LOGS_DIR` parameter. The `vmstat` output contains information on the server kernel threads, virtual memory, disks, traps, and CPU activity. For more information on `vmstat`, see its man pages.|480
|`STATS_FULLDUMP_PERIOD`|The period, in seconds, at the end of which the complete statistics on the server resources consumption is gathered and logged to the directory specified as the value of the `LOGS_DIR` parameter. As distinct from the `vmstat` output, this statistics represents a snapshot of the files contents from the `/proc` directory on the server and contains information on virtually every server resource: the environment of a certain process, the state and configuration of the CPU(s), the number of I/O ports on the server and their configuration, etc. Keep in mind that the amount of disk space needed to store this information may be considerable (about 0.5 KB per container). However, you are recommended to set the period to no more than 10 minutes to regularly check and log the current server state and resources consumption.|480
|`STATS_NET_PERIOD`|The period, in seconds, after which the server network statistics is collected and logged to the directory specified as the value of the `LOGS_DIR` parameter. The network statistics is gathered separately for each network interface on the server (e.g., `eth0`, `eth1`).|480
|`LOGS_DIR`|The name of the directory on the server where the gathered statistics is to be stored.|`/var/log/vzstat`
|====

All the aforementioned parameters are set to their default values during the Virtuozzo installation; so, you do not have to additionally edit any parameter in the `/etc/vzlmond.conf` file to start gathering your server statistics.

  
pstat Configuration File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
This file `/etc/vzstat.conf` lists a number of CPU, memory, and disk-related parameters used by the `pstat` utility. The values assigned to these parameters denote either the warning or the error level for the `pstat` utility to start displaying these parameters either in the yellow color (the warning level has been hit) or in the red color (the error level has been hit). Moreover, if a parameter has hit the error level, the *CRIT* warning is displayed instead of *OK* after the name of the corresponding subsystem (CPU, Memory, Swap, Net, or Disks).
  
The table below provides information on the name and the description of all these parameters, on whether they denote the warning or the error level, whether the real parameter value has to be higher or lower than this level in order to invoke an alert, and on the parameters default values.

vzrmond Configuration File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
The configuration for the `vzrmond` daemon is stored in the `/etc/vzrmond.conf` file. The daemon runs on the Monitor Server, provides remote monitoring capabilities for servers registered with it, and sends alerts to the specified e-mail addresses. Alerts can also be sent from external applications (e.g., via ICQ or by SMS). The configuration file lists a number of parameters, some of which should have user-provided values (from `HOSTS` to `CUSTOM_LIST` in the table below). These values must be enclosed in double quotes and separated by white spaces. The remaining parameters are set to default values which may also be changed. These values are not enclosed in quotes.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* To install the daemon, install the `vzrmon` package from the official repository.
====

.Parameters
[options="header",cols="2a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`HOSTS`|The list of hosts to monitor delimited by white spaces. Both hostnames and IP addresses are allowed.|&nbsp;
|`EMAIL_ADDRESSES`|E-mail address(es) to send alerts to. Must be separated by white spaces.|&nbsp;
|`EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS`|Notification types which can be sent to the specified e-mail address(es).|`SYSTEM_UP, SYSTEM_DOWN, DISK_OK, DISK_BAD, INODES_NORM, INODES_HIGH, HDDBUSY_NORM, HDDBUSY_HIGH, SSH_UP, SSH_DOWN, VZSTAT_OK, VZSTAT_BAD, LOADAVG_NORM, LOADAVG_HIGH, UNINT_NORM, UNINT_HIGH, MEMLATM_NORM, MEMLATM_HIGH, MEMLATA_NORM, MEMLATA_HIGH, CPULATM_NORM, CPULATM_HIGH, CPULATA_NORM, CPULATA_HIGH, SWAPIN_NORM, SWAPIN_HIGH, SWAPOUT_NORM, SWAPOUT_HIGH`
|`CUSTOM_ACTION`|A custom program to send alerts from (e.g., via ICQ or by SMS).|&nbsp;
|`CUSTOM_LIST`|Command-line options for the program specified in `CUSTOM_ACTION`. Must be separated by white spaces.|&nbsp;
|`POLL_PERIOD`|Registered servers polling internal, in seconds.|`15`
|`CHK_MAX_FAILS`|The maximum number of failed attempts to reach a server, after which the "Server is dead" alert will be sent.|`4`
|`LOAD_AVG`|The average number of processes on the server. When this value is exceeded, an alert is sent.|`30`
|`PROC_UNINT`|The number of uninterruptable sleeping processes (in the "D" state). When this value is exceeded, an alert is sent.|`20`
|`CPU_LAT_MAX_ERR`|The maximum process scheduling latency, in milliseconds. When this value is exceeded, an alert is sent.|`1000`
|`CPU_LAT_AVG_ERR`|The average process scheduling latency, in milliseconds. When this value is exceeded, an alert is sent.|`750`
|`MEM_LAT_MAX_ERR`|The maximum memory allocation latency, in milliseconds. When this value is exceeded, an alert is sent.|`500`
|`MEM_LAT_AVG_ERR`|The average memory allocation latency, in milliseconds. When this value is exceeded, an alert is sent.|`400`
|`SWAP_IN_ERR`|The swap in activity, in Mbps. When this value is exceeded, an alert is sent.|`1.0`
|`SWAP_OUT_ERR`|The swap out activity, in Mbps. When this value is exceeded, an alert is sent.|`1.0`
|`DISK_FREE_INODES_ERR`|The percentage of free disk inodes. When the actual value becomes less than this value, an alert is sent.|`5`
|`DISK_FREE_SPACE_ERR`|The percentage of free disk space. When the actual value becomes less than this value, an alert is sent.|`5`
|====

To start monitoring a server, you should provide valid values for the `HOSTS` and `EMAIL` parameters. An external program to send alerts from must be installed on the Monitor Server and its name and command-line options must be set in the `CUSTOM_ACTION` and `CUSTOM_LIST` parameters. Alerts will be sent as messages standard for the specified program.
  
You should increase the value of the `POLL_PERIOD` parameter together with the increase in the number of monitored servers not to create an overload on the Monitor Server. The parameters related to the scheduling latency, memory allocation latency, and swap in/out activity serve to have an alert generated if the system’s performance plummets due to the abnormal values of these parameters.
  
Restart the `vzrmond` daemon after editing its configuration file.

  
vzstatrep Configuration File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
The `vzstatrep.conf` configuration file located in the `/etc` directory on the Monitor Server is used by the `vzstatrep` utility while trying to generate statistic reports and graphics on the server resource consumption and to send them to your e-mail address.
  
.Format
[subs="quotes"]
----
+_&lt;parameter_name&gt;_="_&lt;parameter_value&gt;_"+
----
  
.Parameters
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`NODES`|The IP address or hostname of the server whose logs are to be analyzed. You can set several servers for being processed with the help of the `vzstatrep` utility and separate them by spaces. If no server is specified, the logs of the local server (i.e. of the Monitor Server itself) are analyzed.
|`STATS_EMAIL`|The e-mail address to send the generated statistic reports and graphics to. You can specify several e-mail addresses and separate them by commas or spaces.
|`GNUPLOT`|The path to the `gnuplot` utility on the Monitor Server. By default, the utility is located in the `/usr/bin` directory; however, you may specify another directory for its location (e.g., `/etc/mydir/gnuplot`). `gnuplot` is used by the `vzstatrep` utility to present the server resources consumption in the graphical form. The resources whose graphics are to be generated should be set as the values of the `STATS_PLOT` parameter. For detailed information on the `gnuplot` utility, see its man pages.
|`MUTT`|The path to the `mutt` tool on the Monitor Server. By default, the utility is located in the `/usr/bin` directory; however, you may specify another directory for its location (e.g., `/etc/mydir/mutt`). The `mutt` tool is used by the `vzstatrep` utility to send the generated statistic reports and graphics in the form of attached files via e-mail. For detailed information on the `mutt` utility, see its man pages.
|`LOGS_DIR`|The path to the directory on the server where `vzstatrep` will search for the logs generated by the `vzlmond` daemon and containing the information on the server resources consumption. By default, the `/var/log/vzstat` directory is used. If you have changed the directory where `vzlmond` stores the gathered information, you should specify the full path to this directory as the value of this parameter (e.g., `LOGS_DIR=/my_logs/vzstat`).
|`STATS_PLOT`|Specify the resources parameters whose graphics are to be generated by means of the `gnuplot` utility. You can specify several resources and separate them by spaces. Currently, you can create graphics for the following parameters:

[options="compact"]
* `ve_sum`: the information on the CPU usage for all containers on the server.
* `ve_top`: the information on the CPU usage for 5 containers with the highest CPU consumption.
* `loadavg`: the average number of active processes for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes. Active processes can be running, i.e. currently executed by the CPU, or runnable, i.e. waiting in the run queue for the CPU.
* `io`: the amount of data read from and written to all devices on the server, in kilobytes per second.
* `mem`: the total memory consumption on the server.
* `ints`: the number of interrupts and context switches on the server per second.
* `cpu`: the information on the CPU load on the server.
* `net`: the network information for each network interface on the server.
* `forks`: the number of copies of all processes made on the server during one second.

By default, all the aforementioned resources except for `ve_sum` are plotted.
|====

To start analyzing the logs, creating the server statistic reports and graphics, and receiving e-mail messages with these reports and graphics, you should specify the `NODES` and `STATS_EMAIL` parameters in the `/etc/vzstatrep.conf` file. All the other parameters are automatically set during the `vzrmon` package installation on the Monitor Server.

  
Backup Configuration File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
This file (`/etc/vzbackup.conf`) is in the same format as the global Virtuozzo configuration file and per-container configuration files. All the parameters define the global backup settings, but some of them may be overridden by the per-server configuration file, if the latter exists. Still, other parameters may be further overridden in the configuration file of a particular container.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* The settings in the `/etc/vzbackup.conf` file are valid only for containers backed up with the `pbackup` utility. These settings are ignored when you back up individual containers using the `prlctl backup` command or virtual machines using both the `pbackup` utility and the `prlctl backup` command.
====

.Global Parameters
[options="header",cols="2a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`BACKUP_DIR`|The directory where backups are stored.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* To set the backup directory in the current version of Virtuozzo, use the `prlsrvctl set` command.
====
|`/var/parallels/backups`
|`BACKUP_TYPE`|The backup type. Among the supported types are "plain full (`F`)", "full (`I`)", and "incremental (`i`)". The default is incremental. If it is impossible to do an "incremental" backup, a "full" backup will be made.|`i`
|`BACKUP_NODES`|The hostname of the server whose containers are to be backed up. You can specify several hostnames of your servers and separate them by spaces. If you wish to back up containers residing on the Backup server itself, you should specify its hostname as the value of this parameter.|&nbsp;
|`BACKUP_MAX_CHLD`|The maximal number of servers to back up in parallel for non-periodic backups.|`1`
|`BACKUP_MAX_CHLD_CRON`|The maximal number of servers to back up in parallel for periodic backups.|`3`
|`BACKUP_NOTIFY_EMAIL`|The e-mail addresses where to send notifications about the backing up.|&nbsp;
|`BACKUP_COMPRESS`|Specifies whether the containers are to be compressed when being backed up, and with what compression algorithm. When backing up containers, you can set this option to one of the following values:

[options="compact"]
* `C0`: in this case the container backup is created without any compression. Using this level of compression, you may greatly reduce the backup creation time; however, the size of the resulting backup file may significantly increase as compared to other compression levels.
* `C1`: in this case the container backup is created with a normal level of compression.
* `C2`: in this case the container backup is created with the high level of compression. The size of the resulting backup file is smaller than that of the backup file compressed in the 'normal' and 'none' modes; however, it takes longer to create the backup file.
* `C3`: in this case the container backup is created with the maximal level of compression. The size of the resulting backup file is the smallest and the time of the backup creation - the longest.

This parameter can be overridden by the `-Cg`, `-Cb`, `-Cn` command-line options of the `pbackup` utility.|`none`
|`BACKUP_COMPATIBILITY_MODE`|If set to `yes` and not commented out, the `pbackup`/`prestore` utilities use `vzbackup`/`vzrestore` for operations on containers. Otherwise, `prlctl backup` and `prlctl restore` commands are used. This parameter is commented out by default.|`disabled`
|`CRON_BACKUP`|Specifies whether the backing up is performed as a cron job. If set to `yes`, the values of the `BACKUP_KEEP_MAX` and `BACKUP_LOADAVG_MAX` parameters in the given file are taken into consideration. This parameter can be overridden by the `-p` or `-j` command-line switch of the `vzbackup` utility.|`no`
|====

.Per-Server Parameters
[options="header",cols="2a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Name|Description|Default Value

|`BACKUP_SSH_OPTS`|Options which are passed to `ssh` when it is used.|`-c blowfish`
|`BACKUP_VESTOP`|Defines whether the containers are to be stopped before their backing up. If set to `-s`, the containers are stopped by default, otherwise, they are not stopped.|&nbsp;
|`BACKUP_EXCL_VES`|Defines those containers that are to be excluded from the backup list. Container IDs must be given here.|&nbsp;
|`BACKUP_LOADAVG_MAX`|The maximal `loadavg` with which backing up is allowed. This parameter is effective only if the `-p` option is specified with the `vzbackup` utility.|`10`
|`BACKUP_FINISH_TIME`|The time when the backing up should be stopped and delayed until the next execution (e.g., when running backup scripts at 4am) one can require the backup to be finished before 7am. The backup will continue from the last container at the next execution. The format is: "`HH:MM`". This parameter is effective only if the `-L` option is specified with the `vzbackup` utility.|`none`
|`BACKUP_LIMIT_TIME`|The number of hours after which the backing up should be stopped and delayed until the next execution. The format is: "`HH`". This parameter is effective only if the `-L` option is specified with the `vzbackup` utility.|`none`
|====

.Per-Container Parameters
[options="header",cols="2a,3a,1a"]
|====
|Parameter|Description|Default Value

|`BACKUP_CHAIN_LEN`|An incremental backup parameter. After this number of incremental backups, a full backup is performed.|`7`
|`BACKUP_CHAIN_DAYS`|An incremental backup parameter. After this number of days a full backup is performed.|`7`
|`BACKUP_KEEP_MAX`|The number of backups to store. Only full and plain full backups are accounted. If a regular backup is being performed that exceeds this number, the oldest backup is automatically deleted. This parameter is effective only if the `-p` option is specified with the `vzbackup` utility. If there is no `-p` option, the number of backups to store is not limited whatever the value of this parameter.|`3`
|====

If you want to rewrite the per-server parameters for a particular hardware node, you should create a new configuration file named `server.conf` and put it to the backup directory (defined by the `BACKUP_DIR` parameter in the global backup configuration file.
 
vzpkgproxy Configuration File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
This file (`/etc/vzpkgproxy/vzpkgproxy.conf`) is the configuration file for `vzpkgproxy` - a special utility which can be used to create special caching proxy servers allowing you to efficiently manage your OS and application EZ templates.

.Parameters
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`REPO_DIR`|The path to the directory on the proxy server where the local repository created on the basis of the cached packages is to be stored. By default, this directory has the path of `/var/www/html/download`.
|`CACHE_DISABLE`|The IP addresses of the hosts to be excluded from the caching process. It means that the packages requested by servers and received from these hosts will not be cached on the proxy server. By default, the proxy server is configured to cache all packages from all hosts on external networks.

.Parameters
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`VZTT_PROXY`|The IP address or hostname of the caching proxy server to be used by the `vzpkg` tool for managing OS and application EZ templates.
|`HTTP_PROXY`|The IP address or hostname of the HTPP proxy server address, if you use this server.
|`HTTP_PROXY_USER`|The user name used by the HTTP proxy server for your authentication.
|`HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD`|The password of the user specified in the `HTPP_PROXY_USER` parameter and used for your authentication by the HTTP proxy server.
|`METADATA_EXPIRE`|Defines the period of time, in seconds, in the course of which the downloaded software packages in the `vzpkg` cache are regarded as 'not obsolete'. During this time, the `vzpkg` utility searches for the EZ template packages in the local cache only (without checking the remote repositories set for EZ templates). By default, this period is set to 86400 seconds (24 hours).
|`EXCLUDE`|List of comma-separated packages that are not to be installed or updated during the `vzpkg` execution. The package names should correspond to the name of real packages in the repository and can contain file globs (e.g., `*` and `?`). 
|====

The `/etc/shaman/shaman.conf` file is used by the `shaman` utility to manage and monitor High Availability clusters and cluster resources.

.Format
[subs="quotes"]
----
+_&lt;parameter_name&gt;_=_&lt;parameter_value&gt;_+
----
  
.Options
[options="header",cols="2a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`CLUSTER_NAME`|Set the name of the cluster for `shaman` to operate on.
|`LOG_LEVEL`|Set the verbosity level for printed messages:

[options="compact"]
* `0` - Print error messages only.
* `1` - Print warning messages in addition to error messages.
* `2` - Print information messages in addition to error and warning messages. This is the default verbosity level.
* `4` - Print debug diagnostic messages in addition to messages from level 0-2.
|`LOCK_TIMEOUT`|Set the timeout for `shaman-monitor` operations (e.g., electing a new master or deciding that a slave node is down). This parameter helps avoid situations when `shaman-monitor` performs a cluster-related operation if someone pulls out the network cable for just a couple of seconds (not longer than the half of the `LOCK_TIMEOUT` value). The default value is 60 seconds. The specified value is added to the value of other timeout-related parameters (see below).
|`LEASE_CHECK_TIMEOUT_FOR_MASTER`|Set  the timeout for electing a new master node when the original master node or the `shaman-monitor` daemon fails, or high availability support gets disabled. The default value is 10 seconds.
|`LEASE_CHECK_TIMEOUT_FOR_SLAVE`|Set the timeout after which the master node will consider a slave node as broken if this node and the `shaman-monitor` daemon get down, or high availability support gets disabled. The default value is 10 seconds.
|`LEASE_LOST_ACTION`|Defines the action to perform if `shaman-monitor` loses connection to cluster. This may happen when a node goes online after having been disconnected from network for more than *LOCK_TIMEOUT* seconds. In this case, the watchdog timer has not expired yet, but the cluster is already unavailable, because the master node has prohibited access to the cluster until the node is rebooted. Available values are `crash`, `halt`, `reboot`, and `none` (do nothing).
|`POOL_CHECK_TIMEOUT`|Set the interval for `shaman-monitor` to check for the resources scheduled for relocation. The default value is 30 seconds.
|`RELOCATION_SKIP_THRESHOLD`|Sets the threshold for the number of simultaneously crashed nodes.

If the number of simultaneously crashed nodes becomes greater than or equal to the threshold, the master stops relocating resources from the crashed nodes. When the number of simultaneously crashed nodes drops below the threshold, the master automatically resumes relocating resources from the crashed nodes. The threshold can be useful when multiple nodes are being rebooted at the same time. Without it, the master would start relocating resources from all the rebooting nodes.

The threshold is set to 3 by default and must be 2 or greater. For clusters with only 3 nodes, the threshold is automatically set to 2.
|`WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT`|Set  the interval for the watchdog timer.

The watchdog timer is responsible for performing the action defined in `WATCHDOG_ACTION` (see below) if `shaman-monitor` crashes or hangs up. The `shaman-monitor` daemon activates the watchdog timer on its start-up and periodically resets it to the  specified  value. If something goes wrong with shaman-monitor so that it fails to reset the timer, the watchdog timer counts down until it reaches zero and performs the defined action. Setting the interval to zero disables  the  watchdog  timer. Minimal watchdog timer interval that could be set is 10 seconds.

The default value is 120 seconds.
|`WATCHDOG_ACTION`|Defines a sequence of actions to perform after the watchdog timer expires (happens when `shaman-monitor` crashes or hangs up). When the watchdog timer expires, the first specified action is attempted. If unsuccessful, the next specified action is attempted and so on. If the last specified action is unsuccessful, then the action specified in the `/sys/kernel/watchdog_action` file is performed. At least one action must be specified. Multiple actions must be separated with commas. Available actions are listed in the `/sys/kernel/watchdog_available_actions` file. The default sequence is `netfilter, reboot`.

Virtuozzo Scripts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides information on scripts you can use in Virtuozzo 7.

Overview 
^^^^^^^^

The table below lists the scripts you can use to customize the behavior of containers and virtual machines and define High Availability actions.

.Scripts
[options="header",cols="3a,4a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+/vz/private/_&lt;CT_name&gt;_/scripts/_&lt;script_name&gt;_+|Container action scripts. These scripts allow you to run user-defined actions on particular events. The currently defined actions are `start`, `stop`, `mount`, `unmount`.
|+/etc/vz/conf/dists/scripts/_&lt;script_name&gt;_+|Scripts to be executed on performing certain container-related operations (e.g., when adding a new IP address to the container). These operations should be specified in the corresponding Linux distribution configuration file.
|`/etc/rc.d/init.d/vz`|Virtuozzo start/stop script. This script is responsible for proper Virtuozzo startup and shutdown procedures, including modules loading and container start/stop procedures.
|+/etc/vmprivate/_&lt;vm_name&gt;_/scripts/_&lt;script_name&gt;_+|Virtual machine actions scripts. These scripts allow you to run user-defined actions when starting and stopping virtual machines.
|`/usr/share/shaman`|Scripts used by the shaman utility to manage and monitor High Availability clusters and cluster resources.
|====

Container Action Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There might be situations when you need to do additional actions when a particular container is started or stopped. For example, if you want to be able to access the server file system (or part of it) from container 101, then you can bind mount it inside the container manually from the server. However, after you restart the container, your mount disappears, and you should manually type the `mount` command again. Virtuozzo allows you to automate procedures like the above by using action scripts below.

.Scripts
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`global mount`|This script runs immediately after `prlctl` mounts the container private area. The container itself is not yet running and the script is running in the server context.
|`mount`|This script runs immediately after the global mount script. The container is still not running, and the script is called in the server context.
|`start`|After `prlctl` has started a container, it runs the container `start` script. The script is running already in the container context.
|`stop`|This script runs before the container is stopped, in the container context.
|`umount`|After the container has been already stopped, the `umount` script is executed, and the script runs in the server context.
|`global umount`|This script runs when `prlctl` is about to dismount the container private area. It also runs in the servercontext.
|====

It is important to understand how `prlctl` handles exit codes of action scripts. If exit code is non-zero, then `prlctl` will try to undo the action for the `mount` and `start` scripts. In other words, if the `start` script returns an error, then `prlctl` will stop container, and if one of the `mount` scripts fails, then `prlctl` will dismount the container private area. Please note that in this case `prlctl` will not execute the `stop` and `umount` scripts at all.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Caution:* When executing `prlctl start`, both `mount` and `start` scripts run. However, if the `start` script fails then neither `stop` nor `umount` scripts will run. As a result, `prlctl` might be unable to dismount the container private area, if you set up additional mounts in the `mount` scripts and dismount them in the `umount` scripts. The situation with the `umount` and `stop` scripts is similar. If a script returns an error, then the action will not be taken. Be careful since this allows to create containers that are not stoppable by `prlctl`.
====

The global scripts are named `vps.mount` and `vps.umount` and located in the `/etc/vz/conf` directory on the server. These scripts are called when any container on the server is started or stopped. So, you should include in these scripts those commands that are common for all containers and leave container-specific commands for the scripts belonging to a particular container. Container-specific action scripts are located in the +/vz/private_&lt;CT_name&gt;_/scripts+ directory and have the `mount`, `start`, `stop`, and `umount` names. For example, the scripts specific for container 101 will have the following names:

[options="compact"]
* `/vz/private/101/scripts/mount`
* `/vz/private/101/scripts/start`
* `/vz/private/101/scripts/stop`
* `/vz/private/101/scripts/umount`
  
For the `mount` and `umount` scripts, the environment passed is the standard environment of the parent (i.e. `prlctl`) with two additional variables: `$VEID` and `$VE_CONFFILE`. The first one holds the ID of the container being mounted (started, stopped, dismounted), and the second one holds the full path to the container configuration file. You can use the following fragment of the code in bash scripts to get access to additional container information like `$VE_PRIVATE` or `$VE_ROOT` locations:
  
[subs="quotes"]
----
#!/bin/bash
#
# This script sources container configuration files in the same order as prlctl does.

# If one of these files does not exist then something is really broken.
# [ -f /etc/sysconfig/vz ] || exit 1
# [ -f $VE_CONFFILE ] || exit 1

# Source both files. Note the order, it is important.
. /etc/vz/vz.conf
. $VE_CONFFILE
----
  
The `start` and `stop` scripts are performed in the container context. If these scripts call any external commands, these commands are taken from the container itself. Also note that the `start` script runs before any container tasks (including `init`), thus the `/proc` file system is not mounted inside the container at this moment - therefore, applications using information from `/proc` may be not functional.

Virtual Machine Action Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
In Virtuozzo 7, you can create custom scripts and configure them to run when you start or stop virtual machines. The following custom scripts are currently supported:

[options="compact"]
* _prestart_: this script is executed before a virtual machine is started.
* _poststart_: this script is executed after a virtual machine is started.
* _prestop_: this script is executed before a virtual machine is stopped.
* _poststop_: this script is executed after a virtual machine is stopped.
  
Action scripts specific for virtual machines must be placed to the `/scripts` subdirectory in the virtual machine's home directory. For example, assuming that you created the `MyVM` virtual machine in the default directory, the paths to the scripts must be as follows:

[options="compact"]
* `/var/parallels/MyVM/scripts/prestart`
* `/var/parallels/MyVM/scripts/poststart`
* `/var/parallels/MyVM/scripts/prestop`
* `/var/parallels/MyVM/scripts/poststop`
  
The information to scripts is passed using the `UUID` and `VM_HOME` variables, where `UUID` is the ID of the virtual machine you start or stop and `VM_HOME` is the full path to the virtual machine's directory.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Action scripts you create for a virtual machine cannot contain `prlctl` commands intended for performing operations on this virtual machine (e.g., assigning an IP address to the virtual machine).
====

High Availability Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Virtuozzo comes with a number of scripts used by the `shaman` utility to manage and monitor cluster resources. There are two types of scripts:

[options="compact"]
* Common scripts. The common scripts are located in the `/usr/share/shaman` directory and used by the `shaman` utility to call resource-specific scripts.
* Resource-specific scripts. For each common script, there are one or more resource-specific scripts. Resource-specific scripts are peculiar to each cluster resource and located in separate subdirectories. For virtual machines and containers, these directories are `/usr/share/shaman/vm-` and `/usr/share/shaman/ct-`, respectively. Resource-specific scripts are used to perform various actions on cluster resources.
  
For the full list of scripts and their descriptions, see the `shaman-scripts` man page.

Virtuozzo Utilities

|+--nodes _&lt;hostname&gt;_+|Analyze the logs from the server whose IP address or hostname is specified as the value of this option. You can set several servers by separating them by spaces and enclosing them in quotes (e.g., `"my_hardware_node1 my_hardware_node2"`). If the option is omitted or its value is not specified, the logs from the servers set as the values of the `NODES` parameter in the `/etc/vzstatrep.conf` file on the Monitor Server are analyzed.
|====

The `vzstatrep` utility generates statistic reports and graphics on the basis of the logs gathered by `vzlmond` (by default, the logs are stored in the `/var/log/vzstat` directory on the server) and containing information on the memory and CPU consumption of the server, network resources on the server, etc. You do not need to perform any additional operations to start using `vzstatrep`. All the necessary parameters can be set during the `vzstatrep` execution by using the aforementioned options. However, if you wish to run the `vzstatrep` utility as a `cron` job and/or free yourself from the necessity to manually specify the needed options each time you wish to run `vzstatrep`, you should edit the `/etc/vzstatrep.conf` configuration file on the Monitor Server and set the parameters values contained in this file.

pstat

When run without options, the command checks the GRUB configuration file to determine the default kernel, loads this kernel into memory, and then boots the new kernel. You can also specify the kernel version manually (e.g., `vzreboot 2.6.32-042stab054.2`) to load and boot to the indicated kernel instead of the one set as default in the GRUB configuration file.

  
High Availability Utilities 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
This section describes the utilities you can use to manage High Availability (HA) support for physical servers and virtual machines and containers hosted on them.

prlctl create 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
This command is used to create new containers.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl create _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --vmtype ct [_&lt;options&gt;_]
----
  
With this command, you can create regular containers. A unique container ID is required for this command.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:*
[options="compact"]
. Container IDs from 1 to 100 are reserved for internal Virtuozzo needs. Do not use IDs from 1 to 100 when creating containers.
. If a container is created with an alphanumeric name, the next available numeric ID will be used as its private area directory name. If a container is created with a numeric ID, the same number will be used as that container's private area directory name.
====

.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+|ID to assign to the new container.
|`--vmtype ct`|Tells the `prlctl create` command to make a container. If the option is omitted, a virtual machine is created instead.
|+--ostemplate _&lt;name&gt;_+|OS EZ template to use for creating the container. If omitted, this value is taken from the `DEF_OSTEMPLATE` parameter in the global Virtuozzo configuration file. 
|+--config _&lt;name&gt;_+|Container sample configuration file to use for creating the container. Sample configuration files are located in `/etc/vz/conf` and have names in the format +ve-_&lt;name&gt;_.conf-sample+. The sample configuration files usually have a number of resource control limits for the container and some application templates to be added to the container immediately upon its creation. If you skip this option and the default configuration file name is not specified in the global Virtuozzo configuration file, you will have to set resource control parameters for the container using the `prlctl set` command.
|+--uuid _&lt;uuid&gt;_+|A custom UUID to assign to the container.
|+--private _&lt;path&gt;_+|Path to the container private area. This option is used to override default path to private area from the `/etc/vz/vz.conf` configuration file (`VE_PRIVATE` variable). The argument can contain `$VEID` string which will be replaced by numeric container ID value.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Currently, this option may not be supported by the `prlctl` utility. Use `vzctl` instead.
====
|+--root _&lt;path&gt;_+|Path to the mount point of the container root directory. This option is used to override default path to container root directory from the `/etc/vz/vz.conf` configuration file (`VE_ROOT` variable).

====
*Note:* Currently, this option may not be supported by the `prlctl` utility. Use `vzctl` instead.
====
|+--ipadd __&lt;addr&gt;__[/__&lt;mask&gt;__]+|IP address and subnet mask to assign to the container. If you omit this option, you can set an IP address for the container later using the `prlctl set` command.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Currently, this option may not be supported by the `prlctl` utility. Use `vzctl` instead.
====
|+--hostname _&lt;name&gt;_+|Hostname to assign to the container. If you omit this option, you can assign a hostname to the container later using the `prlctl set` command.

[NOTE]

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Currently, this option may not be supported by the `prlctl` utility. Use `vzctl` instead.
====
|+--velayout _&lt;velayout_ID&gt;_+|Defines the container layout. +velayout_ID+ can be one of the following:

[options="compact"]
* `5`: create a container with the new container-in-a-file layout. The new layout has been redesigned to store all files of a container in a single image, similar to a virtual machine's hard disk. This is the default and recommended layout in Virtuozzo 7.
* `4`: create a container based on VZFS, the obsolete layout used in earlier versions of hardware node Bare Metal.

If you omit this option, the layout will be defined by the `VEFSTYPE` parameter in the global configuration file `/etc/vz/vz.conf`. For the container-in-an-image layout, this parameter should be set to `ext4`.
|====

prlctl delete, destroy 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
These commands are used to delete containers from the server.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl delete _&lt;CT_name&gt;_
prlctl destroy _&lt;CT_name&gt;_
----

.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+|Container name. 
|====

When executed, `prlctl delete` and `prlctl destroy` physically remove all the files located in the container private area (specified as the `VE_PRIVATE` variable in the container configuration file) and renames the container configuration file in `/etc/vz/conf` from +_&lt;CT_name&gt;_.conf+ to +_&lt;CT_name&gt;_.conf.destroyed+. It also renames container action scripts, if any, in a similar manner.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* A container must be stopped before its private area can be unmounted.
====

prlctl exec, enter 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
These commands are used to run arbitrary commands in a container being authenticated as root on the server.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl exec _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ _&lt;command&gt;_
prlctl enter _&lt;CT_name&gt;_
----
  
where `command` is a string to be executed in the container. If `command` is specified as `-` then the commands for execution will be read from the standard input until the end of file or "exit" is encountered.
  
.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+|Container ID or name.
|====

When using `exec`, remember that the shell parses the command-line and, if your command has shell meta-characters in it, you should escape or quote them.
  
The `prlctl enter` command is similar to `prlctl exec /bin/bash`. The difference between the two is that `prlctl enter` makes the shell interpreter believe that it is connected to a terminal. As such, you receive a shell prompt and are able to execute multiple commands as if you were logged in to the container.

  
prlctl mount, umount 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
The `prlctl mount` command mounts the container private area to the container root directory (+/vz/root/_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+ on the server) without starting it. Normally, you do not have to use this command as the `prlctl start` command mounts the container private area automatically.
  
The `prlctl umount` command unmounts the container private area. Usually, there is no need in using this command either because `prlctl stop` unmounts the container private area automatically.
  
.Syntax

|`--no-proxy`|Do not use a proxy server to send the generated report. This is the default behavior, so you can omit this parameter.
|====

prlctl register, unregister 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
The `register` command is used to register a container with Virtuozzo. 
  
The `unregister` command removes a container from the Virtuozzo registry.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl register _&lt;path&gt;_ [--preserve-uuid &lt;yes|no&gt;]

====
*Note:* By default, UUIDs are regenerated.
====
|====

[options="compact"]
* Use the `register` command when you have a container on the server that does not show up in the list of the containers registered with the Virtuozzo. This can be a container that was previously removed from the registry or that was copied from another location.
* The `unregister` command removes a container from the Virtuozzo registry, but does not delete the container files from the server. You can re-register the container later using the `register` command.

  
prlctl reinstall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Recreates a container from scratch according to its configuration file. Copies old private area content to the +/vz/root/_&lt;CT_name&gt;_/old+ directory.

*Notes:*
[options="compact"]
. If any of the container application templates cannot be added to the container in a normal way, the reinstallation process will fail. This may happen, for example, if an application template was added to the container using the `--force` option of the `vzpkgadd` command.
. Currently, the `reinstall` command may not be supported by the `prlctl` utility. Use `vzctl` instead.
====

prlctl set 
^^^^^^^^^^
 
This command is used for setting container parameters.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl set _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ _&lt;option&gt;_ _&lt;value&gt;_

Resource Management Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
Resource management options control the amount of resources a container may consume. If the setting has `bar:lim` after it than this setting requires specifying both barrier and limit values separated by colons.

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+--applyconfig _&lt;name&gt;_+|This option lets you set the resource parameters for the container not one by one, but by reading them from the container sample configuration file. All container sample configuration files are located in the `/etc/vz/conf` directory and are named according to the following pattern: +ve-_&lt;name&gt;_.conf-sample+, so you should specify only the +_&lt;name&gt;_+ part of the corresponding sample name after the `--applyconfig` option. Note that the names of sample configuration files cannot contain spaces. The `--applyconfig` option applies all the parameters from the specified sample file to the given container, except for the `OSTEMPLATE`, `TEMPLATES`, `VE_ROOT`, `VE_PRIVATE`, `HOSTNAME`, `IP_ADDRESS`, `TEMPLATE`, `NETIF` parameters (if they exist in the configuration sample file).
|+-p, --numproc __&lt;bar&gt;__:__&lt;lim&gt;__+|Number of processes and threads allowed. Upon hitting this limit, the container will not be able to start new process or thread. In this version of Virtuozzo, the limit shall be set to the same value as the barrier.

[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Currently, this option may not be supported by the `prlctl` utility. Use `vzctl` instead.
====
|+--cpuunits _&lt;units&gt;_+|CPU weight. This is a positive integer number that defines how much CPU time the container can get as compared to the other virtual machines and containers running on the server. The larger the number, the more CPU time the container can receive. Possible values range from 8 to 500000. If this parameter is not set, the default value of 1000 is used.
|+--cpulimit {__&lt;percent&gt;__{brvbar}__&lt;megahertz&gt;__}|CPU limit, in per cent or megahertz (MHz), the container is not allowed to exceed. This parameter is not set for newly created containers; so they can consume all free CPU power of the server. By default, the limit is set in percent. To set the limit in MHz, specify `m` after the value. When setting this parameter in per cent, keep in mind that one CPU core makes up 100%. So if the server has 4 CPU cores, the total CPU power will equal 400%.
|+--cpus _&lt;num&gt;_+|Number of CPU cores defining the CPU limit for a container. The limit is calculated by multiplying the power of one CPU core by the number of the specified CPU cores. This option also defines the number of CPUs shown to container users. This parameter is not set for newly created containers; so they can consume all free CPU power of the server.
|+--cpumask _&lt;num&gt;_+|CPU affinity mask. This mask defines the CPUs on the server that can be used to handle the processes running in the container. The CPU mask can be specified as both separate CPU index numbers (1,2,3) and CPU ranges (2-4,5-7).
|+--nodemask {_&lt;num&gt;_{brvbar}all}+|The NUMA node mask defining a NUMA node to bind the container to. Once you set the mask, the processes running in the container will be executed only on the CPUs that belong to the specified NUMA node.

|+--quotaugidlimit {&lt;0{brvbar}__&lt;N&gt;__}+|Enables (if set to a value other than `0`) or disables (if set to `0`) per-user/group quotas for further management with the standard Linux `quota` utility. Keep in mind the following:

[options="compact"]
* Enabling per-user and per-group quotas for a container requires restarting the container.
* If you delete a registered user but some files with their ID continue residing inside your container, the current number of UGIDs (user and group identities) inside the container will not decrease.
* If you copy an archive containing files with user and group IDs not registered inside your container, the number of UGIDs inside the container will increase by the number of these new IDs.
|+--ioprio _&lt;num&gt;_+|The container priority for disk I/O operations. The allowed range of values is `0-7`. The greater the priority, the more time the container has for writing to and reading from the disk. The default container priority is `4`.
|+--iolimit _&lt;num&gt;_+|The bandwidth a container is allowed to use for its disk input and output (I/O) operations. By default, the limit is set in megabytes per second. However, you can use the following suffixes to use other measurement units:

[options="compact"]
* `G`: sets the limit in gigabytes per second.
* `K`: sets the limit in kilobytes per second.
* `B`: sets the limit in bytes per second.

In the current version of Virtuozzo, the maximum I/O bandwidth limit you can set for a container is 2 GB per second. The default I/O bandwidth limit for all newly created containers is set to 0, which means that no limits are applied to any containers.
|+--iopslimit _&lt;num&gt;_+|The maximum number of disk input and output operations per second a container is allowed to perform. By default, any newly created container does not have the IOPS limit set and can perform so many disk I/O operations per second as necessary.
|+--rate _&lt;class&gt;_:_&lt;Kbits&gt;_+|If traffic shaping is turned on, then this parameter specifies bandwidth guarantee for the container. The format is +&lt;class&gt;_:_&lt;Kbits&gt;_+ where +_&lt;class&gt;_+ is the network class (group of IP addresses) and +_&lt;Kbits&gt;_+ is the traffic bandwidth.
|+--ratebound &lt;yes{brvbar}no&gt;+|If set to "yes", the bandwidth guarantee is also the limit for the container and the container cannot borrow the bandwidth from the `TOTALRATE` bandwidth pool.
|`--reset_ub`|Resets the current values of all system parameters of the server to the ones set in the `0.conf` file.

* `G` for gigabytes
* `M` for megabytes
* `K` for kilobytes
* `B` for bytes
|`--swap`|The amount of swap space that can be used by the container for swapping out memory once the RAM is exceeded, in bytes. You can use the following suffixes to set swap in other measurement units:

[options="compact"]
* `G` for gigabytes
* `M` for megabytes
* `K` for kilobytes

|+_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+|Container name.
|====

The first command is used to start a container. It will set up all network interfaces inside the container, initialize the container quota, if needed, start the `init` process inside the container, and exit. You can also make the `prlctl start` command wait for all the necessary startup processes to complete and the container to boot into the default runlevel by passing the `--wait` option to this command.
  
When starting a container, `prlctl` executes a number of helper scripts located in the +/vz/private/_&lt;CT_name&gt;_/scripts+ (the first and last scripts in the table) and `/etc/vz/conf` (all the other scripts in the table) directories
  
.Scripts (in the order of execution):
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`mount`|Optional container mount script. If it exists, then it is executed immediately after mounting the container private area. If it exits with a non-zero status, then `prlctl` dismounts the container private area and returns the error.
|`vz-start`|This script sets up IP traffic accounting for the container.
|`vz-net_add`|This script creates the necessary ARP entries and sets up the necessary routing entries for container IP addresses.
|`ve-alias_add`|This script configures the network interfaces inside the container.
|`ve-veconfig`|This script is called by `prlctl` to set a hostname and DNS search domains inside the container.
|`ve-quota`|If the second-level (per-user/group) quota is turned on, then `prlctl` calls this script to form the correct `/etc/mtab` file inside the container.
|`start`|Optional container start script. If it exists, then it is executed in the context of a just started container.
|====

`prlctl stop` shuts the container down. If the container is not down after a two-minute timeout due to an error in an application, for example, `prlctl` will forcibly kill all the processes inside the container. To avoid waiting for two minutes in case of a corrupted container, you may use the `--fast` option with this command. The normal shutdown sequence of `prlctl stop` is described below in the order of execution:
  
. *stop*. Optional container stop script. If it exists, then it is executed in the context of the container prior to any other actions. If it exits with non-zero status, then `prlctl` does not stop the container.
. *umount*. Optional container unmount script. If it exists, then it is executed after stopping the container but before dismounting its private area.
. *vz-stop*. This script deletes routing and IP traffic accounting for the container.

You should use action scripts (`mount`/`umount` and `start`/`stop`) if you would like to carry out some actions upon the container startup/shutdown. However, there might be situations when you have to modify other scripts documented above. In this case it is strongly suggested that you create a separate script containing all your modifications and add an invocation of this script to shipped scripts. This will facilitate upgrades to future Virtuozzo versions.
  
The +prlctl restart _&lt;CT_name&gt;_+ command consecutively performs the stopping and starting of the corresponding container.
  
The `prlctl status` command shows the current container state. It outputs the following information: whether the container private area exists, whether it is mounted, and whether the container is running.

  
prlctl statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Obtains Virtuozzo statistics for a specified container.

prlctl suspend, resume 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
The `prlctl suspend` command is used to save the state of a running container.
  
.Syntax

.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+|Container name.
|====

During the `prlctl suspend` execution, the current container state is saved to a special dump file and the container itself is stopped. The created dump file is saved to the `Dump` file in the +/vz/private/_&lt;CT_name&gt;_/dump+ directory on the server (or in the directory specified as the value of the `DUMPDIR` parameter in the Virtuozzo global file).
  
The `prlctl resume` command is used to restore the container from its dump file created with the `prlctl suspend` command.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl resume _&lt;CT_name&gt;_
----
  
When executed, `prlctl resume` searches for the `Dump` file in the +/vz/private/_&lt;CT_name&gt;_/dump+ directory on the server and restores the container from this file.You can restore the container dump file on the Source Server, i.e. on the server where this container was running before its dumping, or transfer the dump file to another server and restore it there.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Before restoring a container from its dump file, make sure that the file system on the Destination Server is identical to that at the moment of the container dumping. Otherwise, the container restoration may fail.

Migration Utilities 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
This section describes the utilities you can use to migrate containers between physical servers or move/clone containers within the same server.

pmigrate 
^^^^^^^^
 
The `pmigrate` utility is used to perform different kinds of container migration.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
pmigrate __&lt;source_server&gt;__{nbsp}__&lt;destination_server&gt;__ [_&lt;options&gt;_]
----
  
The +_&lt;source_server&gt;_+ can be either the physical server hosting the virtual machine or container to move or the physical computer to migrate. The +_&lt;destination_server&gt;_+ is the server where the resulting container is to be hosted. If the source and/or destination server is not specified, the operation is performed on the local server.
  
Both the +_&lt;source_server&gt;_+ and +_&lt;destination_server&gt;_+ consist of two parts:

[options="compact"]
* _&lt;type&gt;_ denotes the type of computer to migrate and can be one of the following:
+
--
[options="compact"]
* `h` must be specified when migrating a physical server.
* `c` must be specified when migrating a container.
* `v` must be specified when migrating a virtual machine.
--
* _&lt;address&gt;_ denotes the location of computer to migrate and can be one of the following:
+
--
[options="compact"]
** The computer location if you are migrating a physical server.
** The computer location and the virtual machine name or container ID if you are migrating a virtual machine or container, respectively. The location must be separated from the virtual machine name/Container ID by the slash (`/`).
--

The location format is as follows:
  
[subs="quotes"]
----
[__&lt;user&gt;__[:__&lt;password&gt;__]@]__&lt;dst&gt;__[:__&lt;port&gt;__]
----

where +_&lt;dst&gt;_+ is the destination server IP address or hostname.
  
The options you can use with `pmigrate` depend on whether you are migrating to a virtual machine or a container. This section describes the parameters for migrating containers between hardware nodes and for moving virtual machines and physical servers to containers. For information on performing these operations for virtual machines, See <<_pmigrate>>.
  
Container-related Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following options can be used with `pmigrate` when migrating containers between hardware nodes:

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`-s, --nostart`|Do not attempt to start the container on the destination server after its successful migration if the container was running on the source server prior to the migration. This option does not have any effect if the container was not running on the source server.
|+-r, --remove-area &lt;yes{brvbar}no&gt;+|This option takes precedence of the `REMOVEMIGRATED` setting from the global configuration file. If "yes" is specified, then the container private area and configuration file will be deleted after successful migration. If "no" is specified, the private area and configuration file will be left on the source server and have the `.migrated` suffix appended to them.
|`-f, --nodeps [=[all][,cpu_check][,disk_space][,technologies][,license][,rate]]`|During its execution, `pmigrate` performs a number of checks on the destination server (e.g., it verifies that all OS and application templates required for the container are present on the destination server) and if some checks fail, exits with an error. This option allows you to bypass all checks and migrate the container. If you specify this option for a running container, the container will not be automatically started on the destination server. You should manually start it after adding the missing templates. You can additionally use one or several of the following parameters with this option:

[options="compact"]
* `all`: do not perform any checks on the destination server.
* `cpu_check`: do not check the CPU capabilities of the Destination Server.
* `disk_space`: do not check the amount of disk space on the destination server.
* `technologies`: do not check a set of technologies provided by the Virtuozzo kernel on the destination server (for the description of the `TECHNOLOGIES` parameter, See <<_container_configuration_file>>.
* `license`: do not check the license installed on the destination server.
* `rate`: do not check the value of the `RATE` parameter in the Virtuozzo global file.
|`-b, --batch`|Normally, you do not have to specify this option. It is used by Virtuozzo scripts and changes the screen output to a computer-parsable form.
|+--ssh=_&lt;ssh_options&gt;_+|Additional options to be passed to `ssh` while connecting to the destination server.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Do not specify the destination server hostname as an option of `--ssh`.
====
|`--keep-dst`|Do not remove the 'synched' container private area on the destination server if some error occurred during the migration. This option allows you to prevent `pmigrate` from the repeated 'synching' the container private area if the first migration attempt failed for some reason or other.
|`--online`|Migrates the running container with zero downtime. By default, the "iterative online migration" is used. During migration:

[options="compact"]
. The main amount of container memory is transferred to the destination server.
. The container is dumped and saved to an image file.
. The image file is transferred to the destination server where it is undumped.

Using this type of online migration allows you to attain the smallest service delay. If you do not want to use the "iterative online migration", supply the `--noiter` option.
|`--noiter`|Can be used only together with the `--online` option. Sets the migration type to "simple". This option cannot be used together with the `--require-realtime` option.
|`--require-realtime`|Can be used only together with the `--online` option. Forces `pmigrate` to move the container by using the "iterative online migration". If this migration type cannot be carried out for some reason, the command will fail and exit. This option cannot be used together with the `--noiter` option. If the default "iterative online migration" cannot be carried out, and this option is omitted, `pmigrate` will try to move your container by using "simple online migration".
|`--readonly`|Just copy the specified container to the destination server without making any changes to the container on the source server.
|`--convert-vzfs`|Convert legacy containers to the container-in-an-image-file layout.
|`--dry-run`|Simulate the same operations as `pmigrate` completes without specifying this option (connects to the destination server, verifies that all OS and application templates required for the container are present on the server, etc.); however, the container itself is not moved to the destination server.
|`--non-sharedfs`|Use to migrate containers from a shared file system to a non-shared one.
|====

Virtual Machine-related Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
The following options can be used with `pmigrate` when migrating a physical server or a virtual machine to a container:

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`-c`|Mandatory. The full path to the configuration file on the hardware node that was created on the physical server by means of the `vzhwcalc` utility. You can specify only the name of the configuration file if you run the `vzp2v` utility from the directory where this file is located.
|`-q, --quota`|Optional. The partition on your physical server which has any per-user/group quotas imposed on it. This partition will be migrated to the container together with all quotas imposed on it. Moreover, these quotas will be applied to the entire container after the server migration.
|`-z, --eztmpl`|Optional. The EZ OS template to be used to create the container. You may list all OS templates installed on the hardware node together with their updates by executing the `vzpkg list` command. If an OS template is not specified, the `mkvzfs` command is executed during the container creation which makes an empty private area with the name of +/vz/private/_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+ on the server. This private area is then used to copy all the physical server files to it.
|`-d, --dist`|Optional. The Linux version your physical server is running. The name of the version specified should coincide with the name of the corresponding distribution configuration file located in the `/etc/vz/conf/dist` directory on the hardware node. For example, if you specify `centos-6` as the value of this option, the `centos-6.conf` file should be present in the `/etc/vz/conf/dist` directory on the hardware node. You must obligatorily set this option, if there is no `DISTRIBUTION` variable specified in the server configuration file. In case the `DISTRIBUTION` variable is set in the configuration file and you have specified the `-d` option, the latter takes precedence.
|`--exclude`|Optional. The path to the directories and files which will be excluded from copying to the container. This option allows you to avoid migrating the data you do not need. To gain more understanding on this option, please consult the man pages for the `rsync` utility from where it was borrowed.
  
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* We strongly recommend that you exclude the directories you were informed of while running the `vzhwcalc` utility on the physical server.
====
|`-S, --srvstop`|Optional. The services to be stopped for the time of the physical server migration. We recommend that you stop all the services on the physical server except for the critical ones (e.g., the `sshd` service that is needed to provide communication between the physical server and the hardware node) before the migration. This will prevent the running services from modifying any files being moved.
|====

prlctl clone 
^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Creates an exact copy of the specified container.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
prlctl clone _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ --name _&lt;new_name&gt;_ [--template] [--dst=_&lt;path&gt;_]
----

.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+|Name of the container to clone.
|+--name _&lt;new_name&gt;_+|Name or ID to be assigned to the new container.
|`--template`|Create a container template instead of a clone. Template cannot be started.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* container templates do not have any practical use in Virtuozzo 7 and are mainly used in Odin Automation for Cloud Infrastructure. 
====
|+--dst=_&lt;path&gt;_+|Full path to the directory for storing the contents of the cloned container. If this parameter is omitted, the clone is created in the default directory.
|====

Backup and Restoration Utilities 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
Any container is defined by its private area, configuration files, action scripts, and quota information. Backing up these components allows you to restore all the content of a container on any Virtuozzo-based system at any time if the container gets broken.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* For the `vzabackup`/`vzarestore` functionality to work, forward and reverse DNS lookups must be correctly configured for both the source and backup servers.
====

pbackup 
^^^^^^^
 
The `pbackup` utility is run on the so-called backup server. It connects via SSH to the servers where some or all containers are to be backed up and puts the tarballs into the directory defined in the `/etc/vzbackup.conf` global backup configuration file (the default directory is `/var/parallels/backups`). Later on, the container backups may be restored from this directory.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
pbackup [_&lt;backup_options&gt;_] server1 [...] [_&lt;CT_options&gt;_]
----
  
You may specify any number of servers in the command-line by names or IP addresses. You may also enter these names as the value of the `BACKUP_NODES` parameter in the global backup configuration file to avoid the necessity to specify them in the command-line. In this case, you shall specify the `-a` option instead.
  
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:* 
. This section describes backup options for containers. For backup options that can be used with virtual machines, see <<_pbackup>>.
. While the following two subsections provide the complete reference on the `pbackup` and `prestore` utilities, many of their options can be specified in the `/etc/vzbackup.conf` configuration file to be used as the default ones.
====

.Backup Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`-F, -I`|Create a full backup. A full backup contains all virtual machine data.
|`-i`|Make an incremental backup or, if no full backups are available, a full backup. An incremental backup contains only the file that were changed since the previous full or incremental backup.
|+--ssh-opts _&lt;options&gt;_+|Options to be passed to `ssh`. See examples in the global backup configuration file.
|====

These options define the list of containers to back up:

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+-e _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ [...]+|The containers to back up on the server. Containers can be specified using both their IDs (e.g., `101` or `102`) and their names (e.g., `comp1` or `comp2`). If the `--vzcache` option is specified, not the containers themselves, but their caches will be backed up.
|+-x _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ [...]+|The containers that need not be backed up (Containers to exclude). Containers can be specified using both their IDs (e.g., `101` or `102`) and their names (e.g., `comp1` or `comp2`). If the `--vzcache` option is specified, not the containers themselves, but their caches will be excluded from backing up.
|====

It is sufficient to specify only one container option: either `-e`, or `-x`; or to do without any container options if all the containers from the specified server(s) are to be backed up.
  
Container-specific Backup Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
These options must be used with the `vzctl` command instead of `prlctl`.

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`-Cg`
`-Cb`
`-Cn`|Compress the resulting container backups with `gzip` (`-Cg`), `bzip2` (`-Cb`) or do not use compression (`-Cn`). This option overrides the `BACKUP_COMPRESS` parameter in the backup configuration file.
|`-a`|Back up all servers specified in the global backup configuration file.
|+-c _&lt;config&gt;_+|Use an alternative backup configuration file.
|`-s`|The containers are to be stopped before their backing up. In this case, if a client tries to access the containers during their downtime, a temporary "busy" page is shown. This option takes precedence of the `BACKUP_VESTOP` parameter in the backup configuration file.
|`-n`|The containers are NOT to be stopped before their backing up. This option takes precedence of the `BACKUP_VESTOP` parameter in the backup configuration file.
|`-p`|Apply time and load restriction rules for periodic backups. These rules are defined by the `BACKUP_KEEP_MAX` and `BACKUP_LOADAVG_MAX` parameters in the backup configuration file (`/etc/vzbackup.conf`). Without this option, these parameters do not take effect. This option is useful if you invoke `pbackup` in unattended mode as a cron job. It overrides the `CRON_BACKUP` parameter in the global backup configuration file.
|+--desc _&lt;desc&gt;_+|The description of the backup archive. Descriptions with white spaces must be enclosed in quotation marks.
|`-j`|Is opposite to the `-p` switch. Turns off the periodic backup mode and disregards the `BACKUP_KEEP_MAX` and `BACKUP_LOADAVG_MAX` parameters in the backup configuration file (`/etc/vzbackup.conf`). It overrides the `CRON_BACKUP` parameter in the global backup configuration file.
|`-L`|Make use of the `BACKUP_FINISH_TIME` and `BACKUP_LIMIT_TIME` in the backup configuration file (`/etc/vzbackup.conf`).
|+--rm-tag _&lt;tag&gt;_+|Create a backup and then remove the backup with the specified tag. You can learn the tags of the existing backups on the server by using, for example, the `prestore -l` command.
|`--rm-old`|Create a backup and then remove the oldest backup of the specified server/Container(s).
|`--vzcache`|Back up not the containers themselves, but the cache area of the server (`/vz/template/vzcaches`).
|====

prestore 
^^^^^^^^
 
The `prestore` utility is also run on the backup server. It uses the container backups stored on the backup server to restore them to their original servers (or to any other location if the `-d` option is specified).
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
prestore [_&lt;restoration_options&gt;_] server1 [...] [_&lt;CT_options&gt;_]
----
  
You can specify multiple servers (by names or IP addresses) whose containers were at one time backed up and now need to be restored.
  
.Restoration Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+-c _&lt;config&gt;_+|Use an alternative backup configuration file.
|+-d _&lt;node&gt;_+|The destination server to restore the containers to. If no destination server is specified, the containers are restored to the server from which they were originally backed up.
|+-t _&lt;tag&gt;_+|Specify the tag of any intermediary incremental backup to be restored.
|+-r _&lt;tag&gt;_+|Remove the backup tagged by the +_&lt;tag&gt;_+ value. This option is valid only if a single container is specified and if the +_&lt;tag&gt;_+ value specifies the last incremental backup.
|+--rm-prev _&lt;tag&gt;_+|Remove the backup tagged by the +_&lt;tag&gt;_+ value together with all the previous backups. This option is valid only if a single container is specified and if the +_&lt;tag&gt;_+ value specifies the last incremental backup.
|`-l`|Do not restore any containers. Show the information on the containers available to be restored.
|`-f`|Show the full information on the backed up containers (only if the `-l` option is specified).
|`--chain`|Show a tag chain (only if the `-l` option is specified).
|+--desc _&lt;config&gt;_+|Display the configuration file inside the archive with the specified tag (only if the `-l` and `-t` options are specified).
|`--single-tar`|Indicates that a single tar is coming (`stdin`).
|`--skip-check-vzcache`|Do not restore the backups of the container cached files stored in the +/var/parallels/backups/_&lt;CT_name&gt;_/vzcache+ directory on the backup server. For example, you should use this option while restoring a container with cached files to a destination server other than the backup server.
|`--vzcache`|Restore the `vzcache` template area keeping the container cached files and located in the `/vz/template/vzcaches` directory on the server.
|====

The container options define a list of containers to be restored:

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+-e _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ [...]+|The containers to be restored on the server. Any container can be specified using both its IDs (e.g., `101` or `102`) and its names (e.g., `comp1` or `comp2`).
|+-x _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ [...]+|The containers that need not be restored (Containers to exclude). Any container can be specified using both its IDs (e.g., `101` or `102`) and its names (e.g., `comp1` or `comp2`).
|====

It is sufficient to specify only one container option: either `-e`, or `-x`; or to do without any container options if all the containers from the specified servers are to be restored.

.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzpkg list [_&lt;options&gt;_] [_&lt;OS_template&gt;_|_&lt;CT_name&gt;_ [...]]
----

If you indicate a container name, the command will list all EZ templates applied to the specified container. If you indicate an OS EZ template, `vzpkg list` will display a list of application EZ templates available for this OS EZ template. Without any options, the utility lists all EZ templates installed on the server.
  
.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`-p, --package`|Lists the software packages installed in the container or included in the OS EZ template.
|`-g, --groups`|Lists the YUM software groups installed in the container or available for the OS EZ template. The `-g` option works only for containers running RPM-based Linux distributions.
|`-O, --os`|Displays the OS EZ template the container is based on.
|`-A, --app`|Displays the application EZ templates installed in the container or included in the OS EZ template.
|`-C, --cache`|Lists the packages included in the specified EZ template or applied to the specified container from the local `vzpkg` cache. You can omit this parameter if the elapsed time from the last `vzpkg` cache update does not exceed the value of the `METADATA_EXPIRE` parameter specified in the `/etc/vztt/vztt.conf` file. Should be used along with the `-p` option.
|`-r, --remote`|If the elapsed time from the last `vzpkg` cache update does not exceed the value of the `METADATA_EXPIRE` parameter specified in the `/etc/vztt/vztt.conf` file, you should use this option to make `vzpkg list` list the packages included in the specified EZ template or applied to the specified container in the remote repositories. Should be used along with the `-p` option.
|`-u, --custom-pkg`|Displays a list of packages that are applied to the specified container but absent from the repository set to handle the EZ template(s) where these packages are included.
|`-i, --pkgid`|Displays the ID assigned to the EZ template instead of its name; these IDs are unique within the given system. If the +_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+ argument is given, the command shows the IDs of the EZ templates available inside the container. If the +_&lt;OS_template&gt;_+ argument is given, the command displays the IDs of the OS EZ template specified and all its EZ application templates.
|`-S, --with-summary`|In addition to listing the EZ templates available either in the container (if the +_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+ argument is given) or installed on the server (if the +_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+ argument is omitted), this option makes `vzpkg list` display the summary information on the corresponding EZ templates/packages.
|`-c, --cached`|This option has no effect if the +_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+ argument is given. If used for listing the EZ templates available on the server, it makes `vzpkg list` omit all application and OS EZ templates for which the cache has not been created (by running the `vzpkg create cache` command). In other words, with this option on, `vzpkg list` will list only the OS EZ templates ready to be used for the container creation.
|`appcache`|Outputs a list of OS EZ template caches with preinstalled applications.
|+-d, --debug _&lt;num&gt;_+|Sets the debugging level to one of the specified values (from 0 to 10). 10 is the highest debug level and 0 sets the debug level to its minimal value.
|`-q, --quiet`|Disables logging to the screen and to the log file.

|====

`vzpkg create cache` checks the template area on the server (by default, the `/vz/template` directory is used) and if it finds an OS EZ template for which no tar archive exists, it creates a gzipped tarball for the corresponding OS EZ template and places it to the `/vz/template/cache` directory. When a container is being created, `prlctl` just unpacks the tar archive.
  
By default, `vzpkg create cache` checks the tar archive existence for all OS EZ templates installed on the server and creates some, if necessary. However, you can explicitly indicate what OS EZ template should be cached by specifying its name as +_&lt;OS_template&gt;_+. If the cache of the OS template specified already exists on the server, the command will fail and you will be presented with the corresponding error message.

vzpkg update cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
This command is used to update tarballs (caches) of the OS EZ templates installed on the server.

|Name|Description

|`-C, --cache`|Makes the `vzpkg update cache` command check for the packages updates in the local `vzpkg` cache only and use them for the cache creation. You can omit this parameter if the elapsed time from the last `vzpkg` cache update does not exceed the value of the `METADATA_EXPIRE` parameter specified in the `/etc/vztt/vztt.conf` file. In this case `vzpkg update cache` will also check the local `vzpkg` cache only.
|`-r, --remote`|If the elapsed time from the last `vzpkg` cache update does not exceed the value of the `METADATA_EXPIRE` parameter specified in the `/etc/vztt/vztt.conf` file, you should use this option to make `vzpkg update cache` check for the packages updates in the remote repositories set for handling the given EZ OS template.
|====

The `vzpkg update cache` command checks the cache directory in the template area (by default, the template area is located in the `/vz/template` directory on the server) and updates all existing tarballs in this directory. However, you can explicitly indicate what OS EZ template tarball is to be updated by specifying its name as +_&lt;OS_template&gt;_+. Upon the `vzpkg update cache` execution, the old tarball is renamed by receiving the `-old` suffix (e.g., `centos-6-x86_64.tar.gz-old`). 
  
If the `vzpkg update cache` command does not find a tarball for one or more OS EZ templates installed on the server, it creates the corresponding tar archive(s) and puts them to the `/vz/template/cache` directory.

vzpkg remove cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
This command removes the cache for the OS EZ templates specified.

By default, `vzpkg remove cache` deletes all caches located in the `/vz/template/cache` directory on the server. However, you can explicitly indicate what OS EZ template tar archive is to be removed by specifying its name as +_&lt;OS_template&gt;_+.

[NOTE]

You can make `vzpkg fetch` run as a `cron` job (e.g., nightly) checking for available packages or packages updates for your EZ templates and keeping them in the local cache. Having all the necessary packages in the `vzpkg` local cache can greatly speed up the execution of the `vzpkg install`, `vzpkg update`, or `vzpkg create cache` commands since the packages are available locally and there is no need to check for them in the corresponding remote repositories.

vzpkg clean

The only required parameter for `vzmktmpl` is the path to the metafile containing the template configuration. In most cases, however, you also need to include a number of scripts in the template. These scripts will be executed at different stages of the template life cycle (e.g., when you add the template to a container) and ensure the correct template operation. To learn what scripts are required for your template:
  
. Install an official template provided by Odin for the same Linux distribution for which you are creating the template. For example, if you are making a template for CentOS 5, install the CenOS 5 OS template (use the `vzupdate -z` command, if necessary).
. Go to the configuration directory (+/vz/template/_&lt;template_name&gt;_/_&lt;template_arch&gt;_/config/os/default+) of the installed template.
. Look for the files starting with `pre-` and `post-` (e.g, `pre-cache` or `post-install`).

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* The `vzmktmpl` utility is a part of the `vztt-build` package, which is not installed by default. If installed, the package can be found in the `/virtuozzo/RPMS/optional` directory of your Virtuozzo distribution. So, before you can start using the `vzmktmpl` utility, you first need to install the package on your server with the `rpm -i` command.

vzmtemplate 
^^^^^^^^^^^
 
The `vzmtemplate` utility is used to migrate the installed OS and application standard templates and OS EZ templates from the Source Server to the Destination Server.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzmtemplate [-bhz] [--ssh=_&lt;ssh_options&gt;_]
            [_&lt;user&gt;_@]_&lt;destination_server_IP_address&gt;_ _&lt;template_name&gt;_ [...]
----

.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`-z, --eztempl`|Migrates the specified OS EZ template(s) installed on the Source Server. Without this option specified, `vzmtemplate` moves standard OS and application templates.
|+--ssh=_&lt;ssh_options&gt;_+|Additional `ssh` options to be used while connecting to the Destination Server.
|`-b, --batch`|This option should be passed to `vzmtemplate` in scripts if you are going to use these scripts for running the `vzmtemplate` utility and do not wish them to analyze the `vzmtemplate` command output.
|`-h, --help`|Displays the utility usage and exits.
|====

To migrate a template, you should execute the `vzmtemplate` command on the Source Server and pass the corresponding options to it. During its execution, the utility will try to connect to the Destination Server with the IP address of +_&lt;destination_server_IP_address&gt;_+ and move the specified template(s) to this server. By default, `vzmtemplate` logs in to the Destination Server as `root` and asks you for the password of this user. However, you can make the utility use other credentials to log in to the Destination Server by appending the corresponding user name with the `@` symbol to the Server IP address (e.g., `user1@192.168.0.123`). Keep in mind that the specified user should have the `root` privileges; otherwise, the command will fail.

vzcalc
^^^^^^
 
This utility is used to calculate container resource usage.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzcalc [-v] _&lt;CT_name&gt;_
----
  
This utility displays what part of server resources container +_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+ is using. An optional `-v` switch produces verbose output including number of processes, low memory, allocated memory and memory and swap statistics. 
  
For stopped containers the utility displays promised and maximum values the container can consume. For running containers, it also outputs the current values.
  
The high values of resource usage means that either the server is overcommitted or container configuration is invalid.

vzcfgscale
^^^^^^^^^^
 
This utility is used to "scale" container configuration. It multiplies container resource control parameters by the number passed as an argument.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzcfgscale [_&lt;options&gt;_] _&lt;CT_config_file&gt;_
----
  
Container configuration file shall be always the last parameter and the utility uses it to produce scaled container configuration.
  
.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+-o _&lt;file&gt;_+|Output scaled configuration into the +_&lt;file&gt;_+. By default, utility prints its output to screen. Note that the file specified cannot be the same as +_&lt;CT_config_file&gt;_+, otherwise you will lose the configuration file content.
|+-a _&lt;factor&gt;_+|Multiply all container parameters by +_&lt;factor&gt;_+.
|+-c _&lt;factor&gt;_+|Multiply CPU parameters by +_&lt;factor&gt;_+.
|+-d _&lt;factor&gt;_+|Multiply disk related parameters by +_&lt;factor&gt;_+.
|+-u _&lt;factor&gt;_+|Multiply system resource control parameters by +_&lt;factor&gt;_+.
|+-n _&lt;factor&gt;_+|Multiply bandwidth parameters by +_&lt;factor&gt;_+.
|`-r`|Do not output container-specific parameters like `VE_ROOT`, `VE_PRIVATE`, and so on. This option is useful for producing configuration samples to be used as an argument for the `--config` option of the `prlctl create` command.
|====

At least one multiplying argument is required. It is possible to specify more than one multiplying argument to use different factors for different group of parameters. If both `-a` and a specific group option is used, then the specific option factor takes precedence of the value specified by the `-a` option.

vzcfgvalidate 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
This utility is used to check the resource management parameters consistency in a container configuration file.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzcfgvalidate _&lt;CT_config_file&gt;_
----
  
The utility has a number of constraints according to which it tests the configuration file. If a constraint is not satisfied, the utility prints a message with its severity status. Three severity statuses are defined in Virtuozzo:

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`Recommendation`|This is a suggestion, which is not critical for container or server operations. The configuration is valid in general; however, if the system has enough memory, it is better to increase the settings as advised.
|`Warning`|A constraint is not satisfied and the configuration is invalid. Applications in the container with such invalid configuration may have suboptimal performance or fail in a not graceful way.
|`Error`|An important constraint is not satisfied and the configuration is invalid. Applications in a container with such invalid configuration have increased chances to fail unexpectedly, to be terminated or to hang.
|====

It is suggested to use this utility when applications in a container behave in an unexpected way and there seems to be no resource shortage for the container.

vzcheckovr 
^^^^^^^^^^
 
This utility is used to check the current system overcommitment and safety of the total resource control settings.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzcheckovr [-v]
----
  
where `-v` is the option for verbose output. This utility computes the commitment levels of a number of resource management parameters (Low Memory, Memory \+ Swap, Allocated Memory) and compares them with the values chosen by the Virtuozzo administrator in the `/etc/vz/vz.conf` global configuration file. The utility will produce a warning if these configured values are exceeded. Similarly to `vzmemcheck`, `vzcheckovr` takes into account only those containers that are currently running and ignores all the others existing on the server.

vzcpucheck
^^^^^^^^^^

This utility displays the current server utilization in allocated CPU units as well as total server CPU unit capacity.

.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzcpucheck [-v]
----

Without arguments, the utility prints the sum of CPU units of all running containers and the total server capacity. If the `-v` option is given, the utility prints per container CPU units information.

vzctl convert
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Command to convert containers based on VZFS, the layout used in earlier versions of hardware node Bare Metal, to the container-in-an-image-file layout used in Virtuozzo 7. The new layout has been redesigned to store all files of a container in a single image, similar to a virtual machine's hard disk.

.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzctl convert _&lt;CT_name&gt;_ [--velayout _&lt;layout_ID&gt;_]
----

.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+|ID of the container to convert.
|+--velayout _&lt;layout_ID&gt;_+|ID associated with the container layout. To convert a container to the container-in-an-image-file layout, specify `5` after the option. If this option is omitted, the command converts a container to the layout defined by the `VEFSTYPE` parameter in the global configuration file `/etc/vz/vz.conf`. For the container-in-an-image layout, this parameter should be set to `ext4`.
|====

vzhwcalc
^^^^^^^^

`vzhwcalc` is used to scan information on the resources consumption on a server (this can be a physical server or a server) and create a special file on its basis. When launched without any options, it makes a snapshot of the resources consumption and writes down this information to a special file - a server configuration file. The collected information can then be used to create a container on its basis where the physical server will be migrated. You may also use `vzhwcalc` to collect data on your server resources in one place and be aware of their current consumption.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzhwcalc [+_&lt;options&gt;_+]
----
  
.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|`-o, --out`|The name of the configuration file that will be created by the utility and contain information on the server main resources.
|`-t, --scan-time`|The time during which the utility is to be run on the server. The time should be given in the `dhms` format (e.g., `1d2h30m40s`).
|`-p, --scan-period`|The interval with which the server will be scanned by the utility.
|`--mem-scale`|The enlargement factor by which the calculated memory on the server will be increased in the configuration file.
|`--disk-scale`|The enlargement factor by which the calculated disk space on the server will be increased in the configuration file.
|`-d, --dist-detect`|The path to the file on the server where the `distdetect-common.sh` script is located. You can specify several scripts and separate them by commas.
|`-h, --help`|Print usage information.
|`-v, --version`|Print the version of the utility.
|====

The configuration file created by the `vzhwcalc` utility is placed to the same directory on the server from where you have run this utility and has the default name of `ve.conf` (i.e. in case the `-o` option was omitted during the utility execution).

vziotop
^^^^^^^
 
Just like the Linux standard `iotop` utility, `vziotop` monitors I/O usage data output by the Linux kernel and displays the current I/O usage by processes or threads on the system.
  
In addition to the options of the standard `iotop` utility, the `vziotop` utility has one extra option: +-E _&lt;CT_name&gt;_+. When used with this option, `vziotop` shows the current I/O usage by processes or threads running in the specified container.
  
Another difference from `iotop` is that `vziotop` shows actual disk read/write alongside the standard total disk read/write. The latter values represent total read/write bandwidth between processes and kernel threads on one side and kernel block device subsystem on the other. In turn, actual disk read/write values represent corresponding bandwidths for actual disk I/O between kernel block device subsystem and underlying hardware (HDD, SSD, etc.). Thus, total and actual values may differ at any given moment due to data caching and I/O operations reordering in the Linux kernel.

vzmemcheck
^^^^^^^^^^
 
This utility shows the server memory parameters: low memory utilization, low memory commitment, RAM utilization, memory+swap utilization, memory+swap commitment, allocated memory utilization, allocated memory commitment, allocated memory limit.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzmemcheck [-v] [-A]

|`-A`|Display absolute values (in megabytes).
|====

It is possible to use any of the available options, both of them, or do without any options.

vzpid
^^^^^
 
This utility prints the ID of the container where the process is running.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzpid _&lt;pid&gt;_ [...]
----
  
Multiple process IDs can be specified as arguments.

vzps, vztop
^^^^^^^^^^^
 
These two utilities can be run on the server just as the standard Linux `ps` and `top` utilities. For information on the `ps` and `top` utilities, consult their man pages. The `vzps` and `vztop` utilities provide certain additional functionality related to monitoring separate containers running on the server.
  
The `vzps` utility has the following functionality added: the +-E _&lt;CT_name&gt;_+ command-line switch can be used to show only the processes running inside the container with the specified ID.
  
The `vztop` utility has the following functionality added:

* The +-E _&lt;CT_name&gt;_+ command-line switch can be used to show only the processes running inside the container with the ID specified. If `-1` is specified as +_&lt;CT_name&gt;_+, the processes of all running containers are displayed.
* The `e` interactive command (the key pressed while `top` is running) can be used to show/hide the `CTID` column, which displays the container where a particular process is running  (`0` stands for the server itself).
* The `E` interactive command can be used to select another container the processes of which are to be shown. If `-1` is specified, the processes of all running containers are displayed.

vzsplit
^^^^^^^
 
This utility is used to generate a sample container configuration file with a set of system resource control parameters.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
vzsplit [-n _&lt;num&gt;_] [-f _&lt;sample_name&gt;_] [-s _&lt;swap_size&gt;_]
----
  
This utility is used for dividing the server into equal parts. It generates a full set of containers system resource control parameters based on the total physical memory of the server it runs on and the number of containers the server shall be able to run even if the given number of containers consume all allowed resources.
  
Without any option the utility prompts for the desired number of containers and outputs the resulting resource control parameters to the screen.
  
.Options
[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Name|Description

|+-n _&lt;num&gt;_+|Desired number of containers to be simultaneously run on the server.
|+-f _&lt;sample_name&gt;_+|Name of the sample configuration to create.
|+-s _&lt;swap_size&gt;_+|Size of the swap file on the server. It is recommended to specify the swap size to be taken into account when the utility generates sample configurations.
|====

The resulting sample configuration will be created in the `/etc/vz/conf` directory. The file name will be +ve-_&lt;sample_name&gt;_.conf-sample+. Now you can pass +_&lt;sample_name&gt;_+ as an argument to the `--config` option of the `prlctl create` command. If a sample with this name already exists, the utility will output an error message and will not overwrite the existing configuration.

When creating a virtual machine from scratch, you may specify the operating system family or version. If an operating system version is specified using the `--distribution` parameter, the virtual machine will be configured for that operating system. If an operating system family is specified using the `--ostype` parameter, the virtual machine will be configured for the default version of this OS family. The default versions are determined internally by Odin and are kept in sync with other Odin management tools such as Virtual Automation. The best way to find out the default versions used in your Virtuozzo installation is by creating a sample virtual machine.

Managing Virtual Machine Backups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
This section describes the utilities you can use for creating and managing virtual machine backups.

pbackup
^^^^^^^
 
The `pbackup` utility is run on the so-called Backup Server. It connects via SSH to the servers where some or all virtual machines are to be backed up and puts the tarballs into the `/vz/vmprivate/backups` directory. Later on, the virtual machine backups can be restored from this directory.
  
.Syntax
[subs="quotes"]
----
pbackup [_&lt;backup_options&gt;_] _&lt;server&gt;_ [...] [_&lt;vm_options&gt;_]
----

You may specify any number of server names or IP addresses in the command-line.
  
[NOTE]
