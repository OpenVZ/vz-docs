* Parallels Virtuozzo Containers 4.0 for Linux
* OpenVZ

You will learn what upgrade scenarios exist, how to prepare for the upgrade, which actions to take to upgrade a particular product, and how to verify that the upgrade was successful.

Upgrade Scenarios
-----------------

Before beginning the upgrade process, it is important to choose the proper upgrade scenario. You can choose one of the following:

* *Installation on a spare server*. If you have a spare server, you can install Virtuozzo 7 on this server and then move containers and virtual machines there. Detailed information on this scenario is given in <<_upgrading_with_a_spare_server>>.
* *In-place upgrade*. If you want to upgrade to Virtuozzo 7 but do not have a spare server, you can upgrade your existing system. Detailed information on this scenario is given in <<_performing_an_in_place_upgrade>>.

Whatever scenario you choose, you first need to complete a number of preliminary steps explained in <<_preparing_for_the_upgrade>>.

Preparing for the Upgrade
-------------------------

Before you start upgrading your system to Virtuozzo 7, you need to perform a number of preliminary operations. This includes:

[options="compact"]
. Installing updates for your system (see <<_installing_updates>>).
. Backing up all containers and virtual machines on your server (see <<_creating_backups>>).
. Obtaining a Virtuozzo license (see <<_obtaining_a_license>>).

Installing Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, you need to install all updates available for your system. This includes installing the latest updates for

[options="compact"]
* the product you plan to upgrade to Virtuozzo 7 (e.g., for Parallels Virtuozzo Containers 4.7), and
* Virtual Automation, if you use this application to manage your system

For detailed information on updating your software, consult the documentation for the respective product.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* For information on how to update Hardware Nodes in a Virtuozzo storage cluster, see the _Virtuozzo 7 User's Guide_.
====

Creating Backups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, you need to back up all containers and virtual machines hosted on your server. You can use standard Virtuozzo utilities (`vzbackup`, `vzabackup`, or `pbackup`) to create backups.

You are also recommended to perform a full backup of the entire server using some third-party software. For example, you can use the Acronis Backup & Recovery 10 Advanced Server application to create an exact copy of your server and quickly restore the entire system if something goes wrong during the upgrade. A free trial version of this application is available at http://www.acronis.com/backup-recovery/advanced-server.

Obtaining a License
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the type of license you use, you may need to obtain a new license for Virtuozzo 7:

* If a permanent license is installed on your server, you need to get a new license to start using Virtuozzo. You will be asked to enter the license when upgrading your system. You can, however, skip the step of installing a new license and install it later.
* If a lease license is installed on your server, the license will be automatically upgraded to support Virtuozzo. However, you will need to additionally enable some new features, like "rebootless updates" and "Virtuozzo storage", on the Key Administrator (KA) server if you want to use them.

Upgrading with a Spare Server
-----------------------------

If you have a spare server, you can install Virtuozzo 7 on this server and then move containers and virtual machines to the server. This upgrade scenario is supported for the following products:

[options="compact"]
* Parallels Server Bare Metal 5.0
* Parallels Server 4 Bare Metal
* Parallels Virtuozzo Containers 4.7 for Linux
* Parallels Virtuozzo Containers 4.6 for Linux
* Parallels Virtuozzo Containers 4.0 for Linux
* OpenVZ

To upgrade to Virtuozzo 7 using a spare server, do the following:

. Prepare for the upgrade using the instructions in <<_preparing_for_the_upgrade>>.
. Install Virtuozzo 7 on the spare server. For detailed information, consult the _Virtuozzo 7 Installation Guide_.
. Migrate all containers and virtual machines from the source server to the spare server. For details on migrating containers and virtual machines, consult the _Virtuozzo 7 User's Guide_.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* You can convert VZFS-based containers to the new container-in-an-image-file (ploop) layout while you migrate them to the host running Virtuozzo 7. To do this, use the `pmigrate --convert-vzfs --online` command.
====

. If you store the backups of containers and virtual machines on the source server, copy them to the spare server.

Performing an In-Place Upgrade
------------------------------

If you do not have a spare server, you can upgrade your system to Virtuozzo 7 by performing an in-place upgrade. The following sections describe the upgrade procedure for particular products:

* For upgrading systems running Parallels Server Bare Metal 5.0 or Parallels Server 4 Bare Metal, see <<_upgrading_virtuozzo_and_parallels_server_bare_metal>>.
* For upgrading systems running Parallels Virtuozzo Containers 4.7, Parallels Virtuozzo Containers 4.6 for Linux, or Parallels Virtuozzo Containers 4.0 for Linux, see <<_upgrading_parallels_virtuozzo_containers>>.
* For upgrading systems running OpenVZ, see <<_upgrading_openvz>>.

Upgrading Virtuozzo and Parallels Server Bare Metal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the process of performing an in-place upgrade of a system running Parallels Server Bare Metal 5.0 or Parallels Server 4 Bare Metal. You learn how to upgrade

. If necessary, configure containers to use the VSwap memory parameters. To do this, apply one of the available VSwap configuration files to the container. For example, to configure container 101 to use the `ve-vswap.1024MB.conf-sample` configuration file, you can run the following command: 
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set 101 --applyconfig vswap.1024MB*
----
+
All VSwap configuration files are stored in the `/etc/vz/conf` directory on the server; so you can explore this directory to find the right configuration file for your container. For detailed information about VSwap parameters, consult the _Virtuozzo 7 User's Guide_.

Upgrading /vz on Network Shares

Upgrading OpenVZ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrade to Virtuozzo 7 is only supported for systems running CentOS 6 and the latest version of OpenVZ. A system may host both ploop-based and SimFS-based containers.

OpenVZ containers are not compatible with Virtuozzo 7, so during the upgrade, the installer offers you to convert them. If you agree:

[options="compact"]
* SimFS-based containers are converted into VZFS-based ones.
* OpenVZ ploop-based containers are converted into ploop-based ones compatible with Virtuozzo 7.

If you decide not to convert, you will need to manually upgrade OpenVZ containers to run them under Virtuozzo 7 once the upgrade is complete. To do this, go to the `/usr/sbin` directory and execute the `ovzconvert` script. The script automatically performs all operations necessary to upgrade the containers on your server.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* When you upgrade your OpenVZ system in unattended mode, the installer automatically converts OpenVZ containers into the ones compatible with Virtuozzo 7.
====

To perform an in-place upgrade of an OpenVZ system, do the following:

. Prepare for the upgrade using the instructions in <<_preparing_for_the_upgrade>>.
. Follow the steps in <<_upgrading_parallels_virtuozzo_containers>> to install Virtuozzo 7.

Configuring the Upgraded System
-------------------------------

Virtuozzo 7 comes with two major new features:

* _Virtuozzo storage_. Virtuozzo storage transforms low-cost commodity storage hardware and network equipment into a protected enterprise-level storage, like SAN and NAS. It is optimized for storing virtual machines and containers, providing replication, high-availability, and self-healing features for your data.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Warning:* Virtuozzo storage has redundancy built in, so you should avoid running Virtuozzo storage on redundant types of RAID like 1, 5, or 6 over local storage. In this case, a single write operation may affect a significant number of HDDs resulting in very poor performance. For example, for 3 Virtuozzo storage replicas and RAID5 on servers with 5 HDDs each, a single write operation may result in 15 I/O operations. For recommendations on optimal local storage configurations, consult the _Virtuozzo storage Administrator's Guide_.
====

* _New container-in-an-image-file layout_. The new container-in-an-image-file layout is a replacement for the obsolete VZFS layout. The new layout has been redesigned to store all files in a single image, enabling easy container migrations and backups and improving server performance.

During the upgrade, the installer does not upgrade your system to be compatible with these new features. You need to manually configure the system to start using them:

[options="compact"]
* To learn how to set up a Virtuozzo storage cluster and move your containers and virtual machines to it, consult the _Virtuozzo storage User's Guide_.
* For detailed information on how to upgrade your containers to use the new layout, see <<_creating_containers_with_the_new_layout>>.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Both using containers with the new layout and storing them in a Virtuozzo storage cluster requires that the `/vz` partition be formatted as `ext4`. Notice that remounting the `/vz` partition formatted with another file system (e.g., `ext3`) as `ext4` is not enough, and you need to convert the partition to enable all `ext4` features once the upgrade is complete.
====

Creating Containers with the New Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start creating containers with the container-in-an-image-file layout after upgrade, you need to complete these tasks:

[options="compact"]
* Upgrade the `/vz` partition to use the `ext4` file system, if it is formatted with another file system (e.g., with `ext3`).
* Cache the OS templates you plan to base your containers on.

*Converting the /vz partition*

To upgrade the `/vz` partition to `ext4`, complete the following tasks:

. Stop the `vz` and `parallels-server` services:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# service vz stop*
*# service parallels-server stop*
----

. Unmount the `/vz` partition:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# umount /vz*
----

. Convert the file system:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
# tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/_DEVICE_NAME_
# e2fsck -fDC0 /dev/_DEVICE_NAME_
----

where +_DEVICE_NAME_+ is the name of the device the `/vz` partition is mounted on. The latter command will display a message that it has found some errors and needs to fix them. Press *Y* to agree and continue with the conversion process.

. Change the current mount options in `/etc/fstab`:
+
--
.. Mount the `/vz` partition on the device it was previously mounted on:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# mount /dev/_DEVICE_NAME_ /vz*
----

.. Check the current entry for the `/vz` partition:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# grep "/vz" /etc/fstab*
/dev/DEVICE_NAME /vz     ext3    defaults,noatime 1 2
----

.. Edit the `/etc/fstab` file by replacing `ext3` with `ext4`.
--

. Start the `vz` and `parallels-server` services:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# service vz start*
*# service parallels-server start*
----

*Creating a Container with the new layout*

In Virtuozzo 7, an OS template is cached automatically when you create the first container based on this template. Before creating the container, however, you need to make sure that

[options="compact"]
* You have an active Internet connection to access the official repository storing software packages for the OS template the container will be based on. Or
* You have configured a local repository for the OS template.

After that, you can use the `prlctl create` command to create your first container. For example, you can execute the following command to create a new container, assign the name of `ct101` to it, and base it on the Centos 6 OS template:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl create ct101 --ostemplate centos-6-x86 --vmtype ct*
----

This command first creates the cache for the `centos-6-x86` OS template and then makes the `ct101` container on the basis of the cached template.

Converting VZFS Containers to the New Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After upgrading your system to Virtuozzo 7, all legacy containers continue operating on VZFS—the file system used by containers in previous versions of Parallels Server Bare Metal and Parallels Virtuozzo Containers.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* You can convert VZFS-based containers to the new container-in-an-image-file (ploop) layout while you migrate them to the host running Virtuozzo 7. To do this, use the `vzmigrate --convert-vzfs --online` command.
====

To convert a container based on VZFS to use the new container-in-an-image-file layout:

. Make sure that the `/vz` partition is formatted as `ext4`.
+
Containers with the container-in-an-image-file layout can be used only on `/vz` partitions formatted as `ext4`. For more information on converting the `/vz` partition to `ext4`, see <<_creating_containers_with_the_new_layout>>.

. Use the `vzctl convert` command to convert the container. For example, to convert container 101, you can run this command:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# vzctl convert 101 --velayout 5*
----
+
If the `--velayout` option is omitted, the command converts a container to the layout defined by the `VEFSTYPE` parameter in the global configuration file `/etc/vz/vz.conf`. For the container-in-an-image-file layout, this parameter must be set to `ext4`.

Verifying the Upgrade
---------------------

Follow these steps to verify that your system has been successfully upgraded to Virtuozzo 7:

[options="compact"]
. Check that you can log in to the Virtuozzo server using Virtual Automation.
. Check that all containers on the Virtuozzo server can be started and stopped (using Virtual Automation and command-line utilities).
. Check that you can log in to containers using Power Panel.
