About Virtuozzo 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo 7 is a virtualization solution that allows you to simultaneously run multiple virtual machines and containers on a single physical server. With Virtuozzo, you can efficiently share your server's hardware resources among virtual machines and containers.

Virtuozzo is installed directly on the server hardware and does not need any operating system to function. Once it is installed, Virtuozzo allows you to create virtual machines and containers and manage them using the following tools:

[options="compact"]
* *Command-line interface (CLI)*. The command-line interface comprises a set of command-line utilities that you can use to manage virtual machines and containers, both locally and remotely.
* *Virtual Automation (VA)*. Virtual Automation is a remote management tool that allows you to manage physical servers and their virtual machines and containers with the help of a standard Web browser on any platform.

Graphically, a server with the Virtuozzo software installed can be represented as follows:

About This Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _Getting Started With Virtuozzo 7_ guide provides detailed information on installing and deploying Virtuozzo on your server, including the pre-requisites and the stages you shall pass.

This guide is intended for anyone interested in deploying Virtuozzo 7 on their servers.

Organization of This Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This guide is organized in the following way:

<<_introduction>>, gives an overview of the Virtuozzo product and this guide.

<<_installing_virtuozzo_7>>, describes the hardware and software requirements your server must meet to successfully install Virtuozzo. It also provides detailed information on how to install Virtuozzo.

<<_starting_to_work_in_virtuozzo_7>>, provides instructions on setting up Virtual Automation, a web-based tool for managing virtual machines and containers.

<<_performing_basic_operations_in_virtuozzo_7>>, familiarizes you with the way to perform the main operations on your virtual machines and containers: create new virtual machines and containers, start and stop them, adjust their configuration, and so on.

Key Terms
~~~~~~~~~

To avoid any misunderstandings while following the instructions in the guide, please become acquainted with the main Virtuozzo definitions:

_Container_. A virtual private server, which is functionally identical to an isolated standalone computer, with its own IP addresses, processes, files, users database, configuration files, applications, system libraries, and so on. Containers share one physical server and one operating system (OS) kernel. However, they are isolated from each other. Container is a kind of ‘sandbox’ for processes and users.

_Guest operating system (Guest OS)_. An operating system installed in a virtual machine and container. It can be any of the supported Windows or Linux operating systems.

_Hardware virtualization_. A technology allowing you to efficiently use your physical server's hardware resources by sharing them between multiple virtual machines created on the server. 

_Virtuozzo license_ (or _product key_). A special license that you must install on the physical server to be able to start using Virtuozzo. Every physical server must have its own license installed.

_OS virtualization_. A technology allowing you to create multiple isolated containers on a single physical server to share hardware, licenses, and management effort with maximum efficiency.

_Virtuozzo server_. A server where the Virtuozzo software is installed for hosting virtual machines and containers.

_Virtual machine (VM)_. A computer emulated by Virtuozzo. Like a container, a virtual machine is functionally identical to an isolated standalone computer, with its own IP addresses, processes, files, users database, configuration files, applications, system libraries, and so on. However, virtual machines run their own operating systems rather than share one operating system kernel.

Installing Virtuozzo 7
----------------------

The current chapter provides comprehensive information on the process of installing Virtuozzo 7 on your server, including the pre-requisites and the stages you shall pass.

[NOTE]

*Note:* This guide describes how to install Virtuozzo 7 in the default graphical mode. For information on other installation modes, consult the _Virtuozzo 7 Installation Guide_.
====

Hardware Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system requirements slightly change depending on whether you are deploying Virtuozzo 7

[options="compact"]
* as a stand-alone installation (see <<_requirements_for_standalone_installations>>) or
* as part of a Virtuozzo storage cluster (see <<_requirements_for_servers_in_a_virtuozzo_storage_cluster>>)

Requirements for Standalone Installations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The hardware requirements for running Virtuozzo 7 as a standalone installation are as follows:

* x86-64 platform with hardware virtualization support: Intel VT-x (with "unrestricted guest") or AMD-V,
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* To check if the Intel processor supports the "unrestricted guest" feature: 1) Download `vmxcap.py` from https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/scripts/kvm/vmxcap, 2) Run `python vmxcap.py | grep -i unrest`. The result must be `yes`.
====
* CPU: 1.5 GHz or faster, a 64-bit processor is required for running x64 versions of guest operating systems,
* RAM: 2 GB or more,
* HDD: 100 GB or more,
* Network: an Ethernet network adapter and a valid IP address.

The actual number of virtual machines and containers you can run on a physical server and their performance depend on the resources they require. In general, the more resources your physical server has, the more virtual machines and containers you can run and the higher their performance.

Software Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo is installed on a bare-metal server and does not need any operating system to function.

Network Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect to a physical server with Virtuozzo, you need to establish a wireless or wired network connection between this server and the remote computer. So, you must have a valid IP address for the physical server as well as know the default gateway, network mask, and DNS configuration.

Obtaining Virtuozzo 7 Distribution Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use one of the following ways to obtain the Virtuozzo 7 distribution set:

[options="compact"]
* Download the ISO image of Virtuozzo 7 from the Odin website to your computer. In this case, you need to burn the downloaded ISO image to a DVD or to create a bootable USB drive before starting the installation.
* Contact an Odin sales representative and get a DVD with Virtuozzo 7.

Starting Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo can be installed from

[options="compact"]
* DVD discs
* USB drives (See *Preparing for Installation from USB Storage Drives* in the _Virtuozzo 7 Installation Guide_)
* PXE servers (see the _Virtuozzo 7 Installation Using PXE_ for information on installing Virtuozzo over the network)

To start the installation, do the following:

[options="compact"]
. Configure the server to boot from the chosen media (either a DVD disc or a USB drive).
. Boot the server from the chosen media and wait for the *Welcome* screen:
+
image::images/_welcomescreen.png[align="center"]

Choosing Installation Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install Virtuozzo 7 in one of the following modes:

[options="compact"]
* Graphical (default, recommended): install Virtuozzo using the graphical installer.
* Graphical with basic video driver: install Virtuozzo using the graphical installer in a special mode. Choose this mode if the installer cannot load the correct driver for your video card.
* Graphical with framebuffer video driver (available for EFI-based installations only): install Virtuozzo using the graphical installer in a special mode. Choose this mode in case of issues with the basic video driver mode.

Your further installation steps will differ depending on the chosen mode.

Enabling Forced Detection of SSDs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Certain solid-state drives (SSDs) may not be autodetectable by the installer. This may result in issues when you create or join Virtuozzo storage clusters. To avoid this problem, you can force the installer to identify the required drives as SSDs by doing the following:

. On the installer welcome screen, choose the desired installation option.
. Press *Tab* to edit the chosen installation option.
. In the console prompt that appears, add the following parameter at the end of the installation command:
+
+ssd_hack=sd__<N>__[,...]+
+
where +_&lt;N&gt;_+ is the letter of the required SSD (see an example below).
+
image::images/pcs6.0installer-ssd_hack.png[align="center"]

. Press *Enter* to start installation.

The installer will identify the specified drives as SSDs.

Disabling RAID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Disable RAID in BIOS to be able to boot from a single HDD.
. On the installer welcome screen, choose the desired installation option.
. Press *Tab* to edit the chosen installation option.
. In the console prompt that appears, add the `nodmraid` parameter at the end of the installation command:
+
image::images/pcs6.0installer-nodmraid.png[align="center"]

. Press *Enter* to start installation.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Warning:* Any RAID configurations you have will be ignored during the installation. Make sure you will not lose any data because of this.
====
 
Installing in Graphical Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install in the graphical mode, choose the *Install or upgrade an existing system* option in the *Welcome* window and press *Enter*. In this mode, you use the graphical installer and specify only basic parameters to install Virtuozzo.

image::images/_pcs_installation1.png[align="center"]

You can choose between two options:

* *Basic Storage Devices*: Perform a standalone installation of Virtuozzo 7 on a hard drive that is connected directly to your local system (local hard drive).
* *Virtuozzo storage*: Include the server in a Virtuozzo storage cluster. If you choose this option, you will need to specify a number of additional settings described in <<_configuring_for_use_with_virtuozzo_storage>>.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:*
. Virtuozzo storage is a solution that transforms local hard drives into a highly protected enterprise-level storage (like SAN or NAS) with data replication, high-availability, and self-healing features. Using Virtuozzo storage, you can safely store and run virtual machines and containers, migrate them with zero downtime, provide high availability for your Virtuozzo installations, and much more. For more information on Virtuozzo storage, see the _Virtuozzo Storage Administrator's Guide_.
. In a Virtuozzo storage cluster, all servers must have unique hostnames. So if you did not set a hostname for the server, click *Back* and specify one on the screen of defining network settings.
====

Entering the License Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enter the Virtuozzo and Virtuozzo storage license keys:

[options="compact"]
* _Virtuozzo license key_. Every physical server must have its own license key installed. You need to install a license key to use Virtuozzo on your server.
* _Virtuozzo storage license key_. You need to install a separate license key for Virtuozzo storage to use its functionality. If you are performing a standalone installation of Virtuozzo, the field for entering a Virtuozzo storage key is not displayed.

image::images/_enterlicense.png[align="center"]

Type the license keys in the fields provided, and click *Next*. You can skip this step and install the keys later. However, if you do not specify the key for Virtuozzo, you will not be able to install Virtual Automation and its components along with Virtuozzo. For more information about Virtual Automation, see <<_installing_virtual_automation>>.

Configuring for Use with Virtuozzo storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you choose to install on Virtuozzo storage, you see the following window:

image::images/_pcs_installation2.png[align="center"]

In this window, you can choose one of these options:

[options="compact"]
* *Join an existing Virtuozzo storage*. Choose this option to join the server to an existing Virtuozzo storage cluster. You can use this option if you already have set up at least one cluster in your network and want to make the server part of this cluster.
* *Create a new Virtuozzo storage*. Choose this option to create a Virtuozzo storage cluster from scratch. You can use this option if you do not have any clusters in your network or want to set up a separate cluster for this installation.

Depending on which option you choose, your further steps will slightly differ.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* For detailed information on working with Virtuozzo storage clusters, consult the _Virtuozzo Storage Administrator's Guide_.
====

Creating a New Virtuozzo storage Cluster
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you choose to create a new Virtuozzo storage cluster, you see this window:

image::images/_pcs_installation3.png[align="center"]

Specify the parameters for your new Virtuozzo storage cluster. All parameters are described below.

*Main cluster parameters*

First, you need to assign a name for the cluster and set a password to access it.

[options="compact"]
* *Cluster name*. Specify a name for the cluster that will uniquely identify it among other clusters in your network. A cluster name must consist of the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, minus (-), underscore (_), and must not exceed 63 characters.
* *Security settings*. Click this button and specify a password to use for password-based authentication in your cluster.

image::images/instllation-pcssecurity.png[align="center"]

Password-based authentication enhances security, requiring each server to be authenticated before it can be included in the cluster. The password you specify is encrypted and saved to the +/etc/pstorage/clusters/_&lt;cluster_name&gt;_/auth_digest.key+ file on the server.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* You need to authenticate a server only once. After that, you can configure it as an MDS server, chunk server, or a client. So if you later decide to configure the server where you are setting the first MDS server as a chunk server, no additional authentication will be required.
====

*Cluster Roles*

Each server in the cluster can play one or all of the following roles:

* *Metadata Server Role*. Specify whether the installer should configure your server to act as a metadata (MDS) server in the cluster. MDS servers are an essential part of any Virtuozzo storage cluster. They store metadata about chunk servers and control how files keeping the contents of virtual machines and containers are split into chunks and where these chunks are located.
+
When you create a new Virtuozzo storage cluster, the *Metadata Server Role* option is selected by default. To set up an MDS server, you need to specify an IP address to use for connecting to this server. You can type it manually in the *IP address* field or click the arrow at the end of the field and choose one from the list of IP addresses that were detected by the installer (it shows all IP addresses it could find for the server).
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* MDS servers must have static IP addresses assigned. If you are using DHCP, map an IP address to the MAC address of the MDS server.
====

* *Chunk Server Role*. Specify whether the installer should configure your server to act as a chunk server in the cluster. Chunk servers store the contents of virtual machines and containers in the form of fixed-size chunks and provide access to these chunks. All data chunks are replicated and the replicas are kept on different chunk servers to achieve high availability. If one of the chunk servers goes down, the other chunk servers will continue providing the data chunks that were stored on the failed server.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Warning:* Virtuozzo storage has redundancy built in, so you should avoid running Virtuozzo storage on redundant types of RAID like 1, 5, or 6 over local storage. In this case, a single write operation may affect a significant number of HDDs resulting in very poor performance. For example, for 3 Virtuozzo storage replicas and RAID5 on servers with 5 HDDs each, a single write operation may result in 15 I/O operations. For recommendations on optimal local storage configurations, consult the _Virtuozzo Storage Administrator's Guide_.
====
+
By default, the installer does the following:
+
--
[options="compact"]
* If your server has several disk drives, the installer will automatically configure each disk drive except system to act as a separate chunk server.
* If one or more SSD drives are available on the server, they will be set up to store chunk server write journals (each chunk server will get its own journal). By using SSD drives for write journaling, you can boost the performance of write operations in the cluster by up to 2 and more times. For more information on using SSD drives, consult the _Virtuozzo Storage Administrator's Guide_.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* If one or more SSDs are not detected automatically, find out their drive letters (e.g., invoke the console by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+F2* and analyze dmesg output), reboot to the installer Welcome screen, and see <<_enabling_forced_detection_of_ssds>> for instructions.
====
--
+
To check the chunk server settings that will be applied to your disk drives, click the *Chunk Server settings* button.

* *Client Server Role*: Specify whether the installer should configure your server to act as a client in the cluster. Clients are computers with Virtuozzo 7 from where you run virtual machines and containers stored in your Virtuozzo storage cluster.
+
By default, the installer
+
--
[options="compact"]
* Enables High Availability support for the client and for all virtual machines and containers you will create on it. With High Availability turned on, if the client fails, all virtual machines and containers hosted on it will be automatically moved to a healthy server. For detailed information on High Availability, consult the _Virtuozzo 7 User's Guide_.
* If one or more SSD drives are available on the server, configures them to store a local cache of frequently accessed data. By having a local cache on an SSD drive, you can increase the overall cluster performance by up to 10 and more times. For more information on using SSD drives, consult the _Virtuozzo Storage Administrator's Guide_.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:*  If one or more SSDs are not detected automatically, find out their drive letters (e.g., invoke the console by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+F2* and analyze dmesg output), reboot to the installer Welcome screen, and see <<_enabling_forced_detection_of_ssds>> for instructions.
====
--
+
Using the *Client settings* button, you can check whether the support for using SSD drives to store a local cache is enabled.

When you are done, click *Next*.

Joining an Existing Virtuozzo storage Cluster
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you select the *Join an existing Virtuozzo storage* option and click *Next*, you will see this window:

image::images/_pcs_installation4.png[align="center"]

Specify the parameters to join your new server to the cluster:

. *Cluster name*: Specify the name of the Virtuozzo storage you want to join your server to.
+
In most cases, the installer automatically detects all Virtuozzo storage clusters in your network and displays their names as a list box to the right of the *Cluster name* field. If the installer cannot find any cluster, it shows a warning, and you need to manually type the cluster name in the provided field.

. *Security settings*. Click the button and specify the password to authenticate your new server in the cluster. Type the password you specified when creating the cluster and press Enter.
. *Metadata Server Role*. Specify whether the installer should configure your server to act as a metadata (MDS) server in the cluster. MDS servers are an essential part of any Virtuozzo storage cluster. They store metadata about chunk servers and control how files keeping the contents of virtual machines and containers are split into chunks and where these chunks are located.

Defining Time Zone Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify your time zone settings.

image::images/_definetimesettings.png[align="center"]

To set your time zone, either select the city nearest to your physical location on the drop-down menu or click a spot on the interactive map to zoom in to it. You can also select the *System clock uses UTC* check box to set your system to UTC (Universal Time Coordinated), which makes it automatically switch between normal and daylight saving time.

Setting a Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify a password for the root account.

image::images/_installation-enteringrootpassword.png[align="center"]

You will need to log in to the physical server as root to manage virtual machines and containers.

Partitioning the Hard Drive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Partitioning* window allows you to choose the way of partitioning your server.

image::images/_formattingpartitions.png[align="center"]

Do one of the following:

[options="compact"]
* Select the *Use All Space* radio button to create the default layout on the server. If you do not feel comfortable with partitioning servers, you are recommended to select this option and let the installer automatically partition your system. For details, see <<_creating_the_default_layout>>.
* Select the *Create Custom Layout* radio button to manually partition your disk drive. Detailed information on how you can do it is given in <<_creating_a_custom_layout>>.

Creating the Default Layout
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default partitioning scheme differs depending on whether you use Virtuozzo with a local storage or Virtuozzo storage.

*Using with a Local Storage*

If you are using Virtuozzo with a local storage, the installer creates the following partitions on your system:

[options="header",cols="1s,3"]
|====
|Partition|Description

|`/boot`|Boot partition containing boot files for Virtuozzo.
|`/`|Root partition containing Virtuozzo files.
|`/vz`|Partition where all virtual machines and containers will be located.
|`swap`|Paging partition for Virtuozzo.
|====

*Using with a Virtuozzo storage*

If you are using Virtuozzo with a Virtuozzo storage, the installer creates the following:

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Partition|Description

|`/boot`|Boot partition containing boot files for Virtuozzo.
|`/`|Root partition containing Virtuozzo files.
|`/vz`|Partition for storing OS and application template files.
|`swap`|Paging partition for Virtuozzo.
|`/pstorage`|The directory for Virtuozzo storage data. In it, the installer may create the following subdirectories, depending on the options you choose:

[options="compact"]
* +__&lt;cluster_name&gt;__-cs[__&lt;N&gt;__]+: Mount point(s) for the chunk server(s). Created if the Node will host chunk servers.
* +__&lt;cluster_name&gt;__-mds+: Stores metadata about Virtuozzo storage data. Created if the Node will host an MDS server.
* +_&lt;cluster_name&gt;_+: Mount point for the Virtuozzo storage cluster. Created if the Node will serve as a client.
|==== 

Creating a Custom Layout
++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you choose to create a custom layout (by selecting the *Create custom layout* radio button while specifying partition settings and clicking *Next*), the following window appears:

image::images/34411.png[align="center"]

The process of partitioning your system is similar to that used to partition servers with the Disk Druid partitioning tool which comes with most Linux distributions. You can use the provided buttons (*Create*, *Edit*, and so on) to create and configure your partitions. The partitions you need to create differ depending on whether you use Virtuozzo with a local storage or with a Virtuozzo storage.

*Using with a Local Storage*

If you are using Virtuozzo with a local storage, create the following partitions on your system:

[options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====
|Partition|Description

|`/boot`|Boot partition containing boot files for Virtuozzo. Allocate 500 MB.
|`/`|Root partition containing Virtuozzo system files. Allocate at least 12 GB.
|`swap`|Paging partition for Virtuozzo. For details on how much disk space to allocate to swap, see *Creating the Paging Partition* below.
|`/vz`|Partition where all containers and virtual machines will be stored. Allocate all the remaining disk space to this partition (at least 88 GB).
|====

*Using with a Virtuozzo storage*

If you are using Virtuozzo with a Virtuozzo storage, create the following partitions:

[options="header",cols="1a,2a"]
|====
|Partition|Description

|`/boot`|Boot partition for Virtuozzo boot files. Allocate 500 MB.
|`/`|Root partition for Virtuozzo files. Allocate 20-30 GB.

Installing Virtual Automation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose the Virtual Automation components to install on your server. This screen is displayed only if you entered the license in one of the previous steps and your license provides support for Virtual Automation.

image::images/_installation-installingpva.png[align="center"]

Do one of the following:

* Clear the *Install PVA Agent for Virtuozzo* and *Install PVA Management Node* check boxes, and click *Next* if you do not want to use Virtual Automation for managing your server and virtual machines and containers.

* Leave the *Install PVA Agent for Virtuozzo* and *Install PVA Management Node* check boxes selected to set up the Virtual Automation application and its components on the server. Using Virtual Automation, you can connect to the server and manage virtual machines and containers with your favorite browser.
+
If you leave the check boxes selected, you will need to specify a valid and unused IP address accessible from the Internet and a hostname (optional) for VA management node. This Virtual Automation component will be downloaded to and installed in a container, so make sure this container with the IP you have chosen will have Internet access. Once the VA management node installation is complete, you can log in to Virtual Automation by visiting the chosen IP address or hostname and using the username root and the password you specified in the previous step.
+
When the check boxes are selected, the installer performs the following operations after you restart the server:
+
--
[options="compact"]
. Downloads the installation packages for Virtual Automation from the Odin website.
. Sets up Virtual Automation and its components. The installation is automatically initiated once the installation packages are downloaded and runs without your interaction.
--
+
When you are done, click *Next* to start installing Virtuozzo.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:* 
. Your server and the container must be connected to the Internet to download the Virtual Automation installation packages from the remote repository. 
. You can use Virtual Automation to manage servers only if your license allows you to do so. If the license does not support using Virtual Automation, the VA components screen is not displayed. In this case, you must first upgrade your license and then install the Virtual Automation application manually. For more information, see <<_installing_virtual_automation_manually>>.
. For more information on setting up and logging in to Virtual Automation, see <<_using_virtual_automation>>.
====

Installing Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To save time, you can also download and install product updates from the official repository during Virtuozzo installation. To do this, click *Yes* in the alert window that is shown after the installation has started but before any packages are installed:

image::images/installation-updates.png[align="center"]

After you have made your choice, the installation will continue.

Finishing the Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the installation is complete, the *Congratulations* window appears. Click *Reboot* to restart the server and boot into Virtuozzo.

The *Eject the installation DVD* option, when selected, automatically removes the Virtuozzo installation disc from your DVD-ROM drive before booting the system.

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]

*Note:* If you are installing Virtuozzo from a USB drive, remove the drive manually before restarting the server.
====

Starting to Work in Virtuozzo 7
-------------------------------

After you restart the server, you will see a screen providing instructions on how to start working in Virtuozzo 7.

You can manage Virtuozzo using these tools:

[options="compact"]
* Command-line utilities (see <<_using_cli>>)
* Virtual Automation (see <<_using_virtual_automation>>)

Detailed information on both tools is given in the following sections.

Using CLI
~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo provides a set of utilities that allow you to manage irtual machines and containers both locally and remotely.

Connecting to Virtuozzo Locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To manage your virtual machines and containers locally, i.e. from the same server where Virtuozzo is installed, log in to the server by typing the `root` username and the password you provided when installing Virtuozzo at the bottom of the welcome screen.

After you have successfully logged in to the server, you will see a command prompt and can start creating and managing your virtual machines and containers using command line utilities.

Connecting to Virtuozzo Remotely
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To connect to Virtuozzo remotely, use the IP address or hostname indicated on the server's screen. For example, you can use a Secure Shell client to connect to your server. When logging in to the server, use the `root` username and the password you provided when installing Virtuozzo.

Using Virtual Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtual Automation is a flexible and easy-to-use administration tool for managing servers with Virtuozzo and virtual machines and containers residing on these servers. Once you set up Virtual Automation, you can use it to connect to your Parallel servers with a standard web browser on any platform.

Virtual Automation includes the following components:

[options="compact"]
* _VA management server_ (or _master server_ or _management node_). A server (either physical or virtual) that ensures the communication between the server with Virtuozzo (known as _slave server_) and the Virtual Automation application. The master server keeps a database with the information about all registered slave servers.
* _Control center_. A front-end to the Virtual Automation application. You see control center in the browser window when you log it to the VA management server using Virtual Automation.
* _VA Agent_. A special agent installed on a slave server and ensuring the interaction between the slave server and the master server. Without this component, you cannot register a slave server the VA management server.
* _Slave server_. A server running the Virtuozzo software and hosting a number of virtual machines and containers. You use control center to connect to the slave server to manage your virtual machines and containers.
* _Power Panel_. A tool installed on the slave server and used for managing particular virtual machines and containers by their end users.

Graphically, a typical system with Virtual Automation can be represented as follows.

image::images/pvascheme.png[align="center"]

Setting Up Virtual Automation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtual Automation is automatically set up on your server during the Virtuozzo installation if you select the *Install PVA Agent for Virtuozzo* and *Install VA management node* options in the Virtuozzo installer. During the setup procedure, the installer performs the following operations:

. Installs the VA Agent component, including Power Panel, on the server. After that, the server starts acting as the slave server.
. Creates a special container on the server and installs the VA management server and control center components inside the container. Once the container is created and the components are installed, the container starts acting as the master server.
+
The VA management server and control center components cannot be installed directly on a server with Virtuozzo. Instead, a special container is automatically created during the Virtuozzo installation where these components are installed. Once the setup is complete, you can access the container by the IP address you entered in the step of specifying VA parameters in the installer.

Installing Virtual Automation Manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the Virtuozzo installation, the Virtual Automation application is not installed on the server in the following cases:

[options="compact"]
* You did not enter a product key.
* Your product key does not allow you to use Virtual Automation.
* You had no Internet connection when installing Virtuozzo.

Later on, if you make up your mind to use Virtual Automation for managing servers and their virtual machines and containers, you can install this application manually by doing the following:

. Obtain the appropriate product key from Odin. This step is required only if your current key does not support using Virtual Automation.
. Install the product key on the server using the `vzlicload` utility. For information on installing product keys using this tool, see the _Virtuozzo 7 User's Guide_.
. Once the license is installed, create the `pva_opt.cfg file`, open it for editing, and specify the following options:
+
--
* `PVA_AGENT=1` if you want to install the VA Agent components or `PVA_AGENT=0` if you do not want to.
* `PVA_MN=1` if you want to install the VA management server and control center components or `PVA_MN=0` if you do not want to.
* +PASSWD="__XXXXXX__"+ where +_XXXXXX_+ is the root password on the server (set during the Virtuozzo installation). This option is mandatory if you choose to install VA management server and control center components.
* +PVA_IP="__X.X.X.X__"+ where +_X.X.X.X_+ is the IP address to be assigned to the Management Node. You will then use this IP address to log in to the Management Node. This option is mandatory if you choose to install VA management server and control center components.
+
[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* The Management Node must have an active Internet connection to download the installation files from the remote repository.
====
* +PVA_HOSTNAME="__&lt;hostname&gt;__"+ where +_&lt;hostname&gt;_+ is the hostname to be assigned to the Management Node. This option is mandatory if you choose to install VA management server and control center components
--
. Make sure the server is connected to the Internet.
. In a terminal, change to the directory where the `pva_opt.cfg` file is located, and run this command:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# /usr/libexec/pva-setup.sh --install pva_opt.cfg*
----

Connecting to a Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To connect to a server using Virtual Automation, do the following:

[options="compact"]
. On any computer, open your favorite web browser.
. Make sure that the computer can access the VA management node over the network.
. Type the IP address or hostname of the container acting as the master server in the browser window.
. Log in to the container with root credentials (that is, the root username and the password you entered during the Virtuozzo installation).

Performing Basic Operations in Virtuozzo 7
------------------------------------------

This chapter outlines the basic day-to-day operations that you are likely to perform with virtual machines and containers in Virtuozzo.

Creating Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains how to create new virtual machines and containers. The options you should pass to this command differ depending on whether you want to create a virtual machine or container.

Creating Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a container, use the `prlctl create` command as follows:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl create 101 --vmtype ct*
----

Virtuozzo will create a new container with the name `101` using the default parameters from the global configuration file `/etc/vz/vz.conf`. All container contents will be stored in this container's private area. To find out where the private area is located, use the `prlctl list` command as follows:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list 101 -i | grep "Home"*
Home: /vz/private/101
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:*
. For more information on options you can pass to `prlctl create` when creating containers, see the _Virtuozzo 7 Command Line Reference Guide_.
. For information on creating containers with preinstalled applications, see the _Virtuozzo 7 User's Guide_.
====

Creating Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The process of creating a new virtual machine includes the following steps:

[options="compact"]
. Creating a virtual machine configuration.
. Installing an operating system in the virtual machine.
. Installing Virtuozzo Tools in the virtual machine, a set of special utilities that facilitate your work with virtual machines.

The example below shows you how to make a new virtual machine configuration using the `prlctl create` command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl create MyVM --distribution win-2008 --vmtype vm*
----

This creates a virtual machine with the name of `MyVM`, adjusts its configuration for installing the Windows Server 2008 operating system in it, and places all virtual machine-related files in the `/var/parallels` directory.

Once the virtual machine configuration is ready, you can install Windows Server 2008 and Virtuozzo Tools in it. To do this, you can

[options="compact"]
* Use the Virtual Automation application. For details on using this application, consult the _Virtual Automation Administrator's Guide_.
* Enable VNC support in the virtual machine configuration and install the operating system and Virtuozzo Tools using your favorite VNC client. For information, on configuring VNC support in virtual machines, see *Enabling VNC Access to Virtual Machines and Containers* in the _Virtuozzo 7 User's Guide_.

[NOTE]

Performing Initial Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting your newly virtual machine or created container, you first need to configure it. This section describes the main configuration steps.

Configuring Network Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make virtual machines and containers accessible from the network, you need to assign valid IP addresses to them and configure DNS servers. The session below illustrates setting these parameters for the `MyVM` virtual machine and container `101`:

* Assigning IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net0 --ipadd 10.0.186.100/24*
*# prlctl set MyVM --device-set net0 --ipadd 1fe80::20c:29ff:fe01:fb07*
*# prlctl set 101 --ipadd 10.0.186.101/24*
*# prlctl set 101 --ipadd fe80::20c:29ff:fe01:fb08*
----
+
`net0` in the commands above denotes the network card in the virtual machine to assign the IP address to. You can view all network cards of a virtual machine using the `prlctl list VM_name -i` command.

* Setting DNS server addresses:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --nameserver 192.168.1.165*
*# prlctl set 101 --nameserver 192.168.1.165*
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:* 
. You can configure the network settings only for virtual machines that have Virtuozzo Tools installed.
. To assign network masks to containers operating in the `venet0` network mode, you must set the `USE_VENET_MASK` parameter in the `/etc/vz/vz.conf` configuration file to `yes`.
====

Setting Passwords for Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Virtuozzo, you can use the `--userpasswd` option of the `prlctl set` command to create new accounts in your virtual machines and containers directly from the hardware node. The created account can then be used to log in to the virtual machine or container. The easiest way of doing it is to run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --userpasswd user1:2wsx123qwe*
----

This command creates the `user1` account in the `MyVM` virtual machine  and sets the `2wsx123qwe` password for it. Now you can log in to the `MyVM` virtual machine  as `user1` and administer it in the same way you would administer a standalone server: install additional software, add users, set up services, and so on.

The `prlctl set` command can also be used to change passwords for existing accounts in your virtual machines and containers. For example, to change the password for `user1` in the `MyVM` virtual machine to `0pi65jh9`, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set MyVM --userpasswd user1:0pi65jh9*
----

When setting passwords for virtual machines and  containers, keep in mind the following:

[options="compact"]
* You can use manage user accounts only inside virtual machines that have Virtuozzo Tools installed.
* You should use passwords that meet the minimum length and complexity requirements of the respective operating system. For example, for Windows Server 2008, a password must be more than six characters in length and contain characters from three of the following categories: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, digits, and non-alphabetic characters.
* You should not create accounts with empty passwords for virtual machines and containers running Linux operating systems.

Starting, Stopping, Restarting, and Querying Status of Virtual machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a virtual machine and container has been created, it can be managed like a usual computer.

Starting Virtual machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can start virtual machines and containers with the `prlctl start` command. For example:

* To start the container `101`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl start 101*
----

* To start the virtual machine `MyVM`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl start MyVM*
----

Stopping Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can stop virtual machines and containers with the `prlctl stop` command. For example:

* To stop the container `101`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl stop 101*
----

* To stop the virtual machine `MyVM`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl stop MyVM*
----

Restarting Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can restart virtual machines andcontainers with the `prlctl restart` command. For example:

* To restart the container `101`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl restart 101*
----

* To restart the virtual machine `MyVM`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl restart MyVM*
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Note:* Restarting virtual machines requires a guest OS and Parallels Tools to be installed.
====

Checking Status of Virtual Machines and Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can check the status of a container or virtual machine with the `prlctl status` command. For example:

* To check the status of the container `101`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl status 101*
VEID 101 exists mounted running
----

* To check the status of the virtual machine `MyVM`:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl status MyVM*
VM MyVM exists stopped
----

Listing Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get an overview of the virtual machines and containers existing on the physical server and to get additional information about them--their IP addresses, hostnames, current resource consumption, and so on--use the `prlctl list` command. In the most general case, you can get a list of all virtual machines and containers by issuing the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -a*
                                    ID   NPROC  STATUS   IP_ADDR      HOSTNAME
                                   101      12  started  10.10.1.101  CT101
{b8cb6d99-1af1-453d-a302-2fddd8f86769}      -   stopped  10.10.100.1  VM_1
----

The `-a` option tells the `prlctl list` command to output both running and stopped containers and virtual machines. By default, only running containers and virtual machines are shown. The default columns inform you of container and virtual machine IDs, the number of running processes inside containers and virtual machines, their status, IP addresses, and hostnames. This output can be customized as desired by using `prlctl list` command line options. For example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl list -a -o name,ctid*
NAME                                       ID
-                                         101
My_Vm   {b8cb6d99-1af1-453d-a302-2fddd8f86769}
----

This command displays only the names of the virtual machines and containers existing on the physical server. The full list of the `prlctl list` command options for containers and virtual machines is available in the _Virtuozzo 7 Command Line Reference Guide_.

Deleting Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete a virtual machine or container that is not needed anymore using the `prlctl delete` command. Note that you cannot delete a running or mounted virtual machine or container. The example below illustrates deleting the running container `101`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl delete 101*
Deleting Container private area: /vz/private/101
Container is currently running (stop first)
*# prlctl stop 101*
Stopping Container...
Container was stopped
Container is unmounted
*# prlctl delete 101*
Deleting Container private area: /vz/private/101
Container private area was deleted
----

Running Commands in Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo allows you to execute arbitrary commands inside virtual machines and containers by running them on the physical server, i.e. without the need to log in to the respective virtual machine or container. For example, this can be useful in these cases:

[options="compact"]
* If you do not know the virtual machine or container login information, but need to run some diagnosis commands to verify that it is operational.
* If network access is absent for a virtual machine or container.

In both cases, you can use the `prlctl exec` command to run a command inside the respective virtual machine or container. The session below illustrates the situation when you run the stopped SSH daemon inside a Linux virtual machine with the name of `My_Linux`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl exec My_Linux /etc/init.d/sshd status*
sshd is stopped
*# prlctl exec My_Linux /etc/init.d/sshd start*
Starting sshd:[OK]
*# prlctl exec My_Linux /etc/init.d/sshd status*
sshd (pid 26187) is running...
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]
====
*Notes:* 
. You can use the `prlctl exec` command only inside virtual machines that have Virtuozzo Tools installed
. The `prlctl exec` command is executed inside a virtual machine or container from the `/` directory rather than from `/root` one.
====

Monitoring Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Virtuozzo, you can use the `pstat` utility to monitor system resources in real time. When executed, the utility displays the status and load of the system: its disk, network, CPU, memory, and other parameters. It also provides the list of running virtual machines and containers together with their resources consumption statistics. For example, you can run the following command on the server to view your current system resources:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# pstat -d 5*

----

The command output is updated with the time interval equal to the value specified after the `-d` (delay) option measured in seconds. In the session above, the statistics displayed is renewed every five seconds. If the `-d` option is not specified, the default interval equals 1 second.

As you can see, the utility provides real-time information on all main resources subsystems pertaining both to the physical server and to its virtual machines and containers: the disk, network, CPU, and memory subsystems. You may want to shrink the output of the utility by specifying the `-b` (brief) option instead of `-v` (verbose), or to do without any options to use the "normal" mode of displaying.

The following information is displayed by default per each virtual machine or container:

|ST|Virtual machine or container status. If there are no failed counters and the latency values are normal, the status is "OK". Otherwise, it is displayed in red as "!!". You can sort virtual machines and containers by their status to see the problem virtual machines and containers first.
|%VM|Virtual memory usage, in per cent to the total memory. The first number is how much virtual memory is being used, and the second one is the virtual memory barrier.
|%KM|Kernel memory usage, in per cent to the normal zone size. The first number is how much kernel memory is being used, and the second one is the kernel memory barrier.
|CPU|CPU usage in per cent to all available CPUs. The first number is how much of the CPU power is being used by the virtual machine or container, and the second one is its guaranteed share judging by the `cpuunits` parameter. Note that the actual CPU usage may be higher than the guaranteed one.
|FCNT|The number of failed counters for all the resource parameters. In the standard mode of displaying, this number represents the increase of failed counters since the previous screen update, whereas in the average mode of displaying, it represents an absolute failed counters sum for the given virtual machine or container.
|MLAT|Maximal scheduling latency for the virtual machine or container, in ms. This parameter shows the maximal scheduling latency inside the given virtual machine or container, i.e. for how long (at the utmost) a process inside the virtual machine or container awaits for the CPU.
|NAME|Virtual machine or container name.
|====

The *%VM*, *%KM*, and *CPU* columns provide two values per column separated by a slash for each virtual machine and container. The first value indicates the real usage of the corresponding parameter by the virtual machine or container, and the second one--the maximal value allowed for the virtual machine or container.

Migrating Virtual Machines and Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtuozzo provides a special utility -- `pmigrate` -- allowing you to perform different types of migration.

Migrating a Physical Server to a Virtual Machine or Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `pmigrate` utility allows you to migrate physical servers to virtual machines and containers on the physical server running Virtuozzo. For example, to move a physical server to the `MyVM` virtual machine, you can execute the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# pmigrate h 192.168.1.130 v localhost/MyVM*
----

where

[options="compact"]
* `h` denotes that you are migrating a physical server.
* `192.168.1.130` is the IP address of the physical server to be migrated.
* `v` indicates that the physical server is to be moved to a virtual machine.
* `localhost/MyVM` denotes that the physical server must be migrated to the `MyVM` virtual machine on the local server.

If you want to migrate the same physical server to a container, just specify `c` instead of `v` and the ID of the resulting container (e.g. `101`) instead of `MyVM`.

Migrating Virtual Machines and Containers between Physical Servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `pmigrate` utility supports migrating virtual machines and containers between physical servers running Virtuozzo. For example, to migrate a virtual machine with the name of `MyVM` from the server having the IP address of `192.168.1.130` to the local server, run this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# pmigrate v 192.168.1.130/MyVM v localhost/MyVM*
----

Specifying `c` instead of `v` and the container ID instead of `MyVM` allows you to migrate containers between physical servers with Virtuozzo:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# pmigrate c 192.168.1.130/101 c localhost/101*
----

Migrating Containers to Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also migrate containers to virtual machines. The containers to be migrated can reside on both local and remote physical servers. For example, you can migrate container `101` residing on the physical server with the IP address of `192.168.1.130` to the `MyVM` virtual machine on the local server as follows:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# pmigrate c 192.168.1.130/101 v MyVM*
----

In its turn, you can migrate container `101` from the local server to the `MyVM` virtual machine on the physical server with the IP address of `192.168.1.130` by executing this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# pmigrate c 101 v 192.168.1.130/MyVM*
----

[NOTE]
[subs="quotes"]

*Note:* If you are migrating from/to a remote physical server, you will be asked for the `root` credentials to log in to this server.

Managing Virtual Machine and Container Backups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A regular backing up of the existing virtual machines and containers is essential for any physical server reliability. In Virtuozzo, you can use the `prlctl backup` and `prlctl restore` commands to back up and restore your virtual machines and containers.

[NOTE]

*Note:* You can also use the `pbackup` and `prestore` utilities to back up and restore your virtual machines and containers.

Creating Backups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `prlctl backup` command allows you to create virtual machine and container backups on both local and remote physical servers. You can back up to any server running the Virtuozzo software and having sufficient space for storing virtual machine and container backups. For example, to make a full backup of the `MyVM` virtual machine residing on the local server and save it on the destination physical server with the IP address of `10.10.100.1`, run the following command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl backup MyVM -s root:1qaz2wsx@10.10.100.1*
----

`root:1qaz2wsx` before the destination server IP address denotes the root credentials used to log in to this server. If you do not specify these credentials, you will be asked to do so during the command execution.

Restoring Backups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To restore a backup of a virtual machine and container, you can use the `prlctl restore` command. This command supports restoring backups to a local server only. For example, to restore a backup of the `MyVM` virtual machine stored on the remote server with the IP address of `10.10.100.1`, you can run this command on the local server:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl restore MyVM -s root:1qaz2wsx@10.10.100.1*
----

If you have two or more backups of the `MyVM` virtual machine, you can use the `prlctl backup-list` command to find out the ID assigned to a specific backup:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl backup-list -s 10.10.100.1*
ID              Backup_ID       Node        Date                  Type
{e3c8be4a-...}  {7a5e7605-...}  server.com  2012-08-21 10:10:32   f
{e3c8be4a-...}  {24a3011c-...}  server.com  2012-08-21 11:12:35   f
----

You can now indicate the found ID after the `-t` option to tell `prlctl backup` to restore a particular backup. For example, to restore the backup that was created first, execute this command:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl restore -t {7a5e7605-a467-4e04-9f5f-6f0078b5f9f5} -s root:1qaz2wsx@ \
10.10.100.1*
