Virtuozzo 7 Technical Preview - Containers Readme
=================================================
:doctype: book

Overview
--------

It has been more than a decade since we released Virtuozzo containers. Back then Linux kernel lacked isolation technologies and we had to implement those as a custom kernel patch. Since then we have worked closely with the community to bring these technologies to upstream. Today they are  a part of most modern Linux kernels and this release is the first that will benefit significantly from our joint efforts and the strong upstream foundation.

This is an early technology preview of Virtuozzo 7. We have made some good progress, but this is just the beginning. Much more still needs to be done. At this point  we replaced the containers engine and made our tools work with the new kernel technologies. We consider this technical preview a major milestone on the road to the official Virtuozzo 7 release and want to share the progress with our customers.

Key changes:

* Virtuozzo 7 is based on RHEL7 and Kernel 3.10+.
* Containers are using kernel features cgroups and namespaces that limit, account for, and isolate resource usage as isolated namespaces of a collection of processes. The beancounters interface remains in place for backward compatibility. At the same time it acts as a proxy for actual cgroups and namespaces implementation.
* UUID instead of VEID for container identification. You can use UUID or name to identify a container. By default `vzctl` will treat the former VEID parameter as name.
* VCMM 4th generation of memory manager. We switched to memcg. By balancing and configuring memcg limits we will get the exact overcommit, shadow gangs, swap, page cache overuse Virtuozzo parameters. This will be done by a userspace daemon.

Guest operating systems supported in Virtuozzo 7 Technical Preview - Containers:

[options="compact"]
* CentOS 7 (x86_64)
* CentOS 6 (x86_64)
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (x86_64)
* Debian 8 (x86_64)


The following features are not yet implemented: 

[options="compact"]
* KVM-based virtual machines.
* Instance migration based on the userspace CRIU project.
* Integration with Virtuozzo storage.
* A new backup API and integrated backup solution.
* Integration with PVA and PVA agent.

Installing Virtuozzo 7 Technical Preview - Containers
-----------------------------------------------------

Virtuozzo 7 installer is based on the RHEL7 installer. You can install Virtuozzo directly on bare hardware or in a virtual machine. The following configurations are recommended:

[options="compact"]
* 4 vCPU
* 8GB RAM
* 100GB Disk

Installing Virtuozzo 7 Technical Preview on Bare Metal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the technical preview on a hardware node, burn the distribution ISO image on a USB stick, boot your hardware node from it, and follow wizard's instructions.

Installing Virtuozzo 7 Technical Preview in Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the technical preview in a virtual machine, for example, one created with Virtuozzo 6, do the following:

. Login to the hardware node running Virtuozzo 6 and create a CentOS 7 virtual machine. For example:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl create vz7vm -d centos7*
----
. Mount the distribution ISO image:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set vz7vm --device-set cdrom0 --image _&lt;path_to_virtuozzo7_ISO&gt;_*
----
. Check the virtual CD-ROM status and connect the CD if needed:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set vz7vm --device-set cdrom0 --connect*
----
. Assign an IP address using DHCP:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set vz7vm --ifname net0 --dhcp yes --network Bridged*
----
+
or manually:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set vz7vm --ifname eth0 --ipadd _&lt;IP&gt;_ --nameserver _&lt;DNS_server&gt;_*
----
. Start the virtual machine:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl start vz7vm*
----
. Set VNC mapping to the host and use it for installation:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl set vz7vm --vnc-mode manual --vnc-port 5901 --vnc-passwd _&lt;passwd&gt;_*
----
. Boot from the virtual CD-ROM and follow wizard's instructions to install the Virtuozzo 7 Technical Preview.

After installation has finished, login to the Virtuozzo 7 node or virtual machine and verify installation as follows.

. Check the version of Virtuozzo:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlsrvctl info*
----
. List all installed packages: 
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# yum list*
----
. Update your Virtuozzo installation to make sure you've got the latest version:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# yum update*
----

Your Virtuozzo 7 installation is ready. For information on how you can create and manage containers, see the _Virtuozzo 7 Technical Preview - Containers User's Guide_ bundled with the distribution.
